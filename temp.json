Study Sessions", "body": {"other": "In 2013, Santa Monica was named 1 of just 5 winners (out of 305 entries nationwide) in Bloomberg Philanthropies first-ever Mayors Challenge - a competition designed to ignite innovation in local government. Santa Monica was chosen because we posed the idea that local government exists for a higher purpose than just providing specific services  that our ultimate goal is to help the people in our community thrive.  This ground-breaking approach grew out of our communitys work on a Youth Wellbeing Report Card that crossed traditional lines between the work of city government, schools, non-profits and community organizations, families and individual citizens. It sought to measure and improve performance toward the wellbeing of young people. Bloomberg saw the potential to apply this to the wellbeing of the whole community and all its residents. The challenge to be solved starts with the reality that local government generally lacks critical data to measure our contribution and apply that data to systematically improve lives and our shared sense of community.   By applying leading edge practices to local governance, the City of Santa Monica proposed to create a new tool - the Local Wellbeing Index - that would help us genuinely understand trends, needs, and challenges faced by the people we serve. This concept of using data to understand people and drive change evolved over time thanks to lessons learned through our pioneering efforts to protect the environment, preserve affordable housing, address homelessness with compassion, and do whatever it takes to help our children succeed. Development of this new Wellbeing Index was guided by an international panel of experts to pare the emerging interdisciplinary research of wellbeing with the practicalities of local government.  The five dimensions of civic wellbeing defined below offer a foundation for a proposed framework. (Please see Attachment A: Wellbeing Framework)       Community: Often described as social capital, a community with strong connections among its inhabitants can flourish in good times and withstand the tough ones. How strong is the sense of community and connection in Santa Monica?       Place: The characteristics of the area in which people livephysical, social, environmental and economicaffect how wellbeing is fostered and supported. Does Santa Monicas physical and social environment promote/support wellbeing?       Learning: Education is linked to virtually all wellbeing outcomes, but even beyond measures of high school or college graduations, lifelong learning in and out of the classroom is a key factor of wellbeing. Do people have the opportunity to enrich their knowledge across the lifespan?       Health: Being and feeling healthyor at least having the tools and resources needed to manage any health challengesare essential to an overall sense of wellbeing. How healthy is Santa Monica?       Economic Opportunity: Economic conditions, including opportunities for upward mobility, are key to creating a community in which a diverse population can live and thrive. Is Santa Monica a place in which a diverse population can live and thrive? Staff have begun inventorying core municipal services throughout the organization and mapping work efforts to a primary dimension. This work, which will continue over the next few months, will also fully integrate with environmental sustainability and good governance. This staff work has already produced new insights and perspectives into how the work of different departments and divisions does  and does not  align together in ways that transcends traditional lines on departmental organization charts. The City has a long history of promoting local quality of life by providing a comprehensive range of City services (full service city.) The City has also in recent decades championed visionary values of social equity, environmental sustainability and enhancing the wellbeing of the community for the sake of current and future generations. Yet the City of Santa Monica does not have a Council-adopted overall vision or mission statement, nor a strategic plan. (It does have a motto that presages the concept of civic wellbeing: Populus felix in urbe felice, loosely translated as Happy people in a happy city.). In 1994 Council adopted Santa Monicas first Sustainable City Plan which identified organizational and community-wide sustainability goals for the environment, local economy and community quality of life, and established metrics to track progress toward meeting those goals. In 2003 that plan was significantly expanded following a 15 month community process that resulted in the current plan that includes nine goal areas focusing on Resource Conservation, Environmental and Public Health, Economic Development, Housing, Open Space and Land Use, Transportation, Community Education and Civic Participation, Human Dignity, and Arts and Culture.  Last summer, Council assessed a dozen major initiatives then underway and chose five Strategic Goals. Those top priorities (none of which were new efforts although each involved a refocusing on tangible long-term outcomes), are listed below. Each has been mapped to a primary wellbeing dimension:       Maintaining an inclusive and diverse community       Establishing a new model for mobility       Securing local control of the City land occupied by the Santa Monica Airport       Taking a leadership role in regional efforts to address homelessness       Fostering a community partnership to Learn + Thrive   As a full-service city, City departments provide police, fire, transportation (including a regional bus system and general aviation airport), water, wastewater, refuse, streets, parking, planning, building, engineering, free public Wi-Fi, a high speed fiber optic network, parks, affordable housing, economic development, sustainability, library, rent control, recreational, social, cultural, and educational services to the community. Most of the Citys core operations also align to one or more dimensions of the proposed framework, thus reinforcing that Santa Monicas priorities and municipal services further community, place, learning, health, economic opportunity, sustainability, and good governance goals and outcomes. While Santa Monicas foundation of wellbeing and sustainability is unique, cities often cite economic health, environmental health, accessibility, safety, and livability as key outcomes.  An interdepartmental team comprised of representatives from the Finance Department, Office of Civic Wellbeing, Department of Public Works, and City Managers Office plus the leads of the five Strategic Goals, who were the first employees to map and align work efforts within the framework, are leading the development of the framework and evolution of the Citys performance management system. On January 10, the Citys Leadership Team of Department Heads and Division Managers, plus Budget Analysts, convened to learn about the Wellbeing Index, its dimensions, and how the framework will be incorporated into the Biennial Budget. About a week later, on January 18, the same group of staff re-convened to learn how other cities have used organizational frameworks as the foundation of their performance management systems and began to map key daily municipal services and operations within the proposed framework. (Please see Attachment B: Workshop Photos) Over the next few months, staff will continue to map their operations. As the framework is meant to be a comprehensive and living tool, able to capture the Citys dynamic work, changes and additions will be made throughout the budget cycle.   How well are we succeeding? How can we both improve services and achieve better results? Its important to know what needs to be done, why it needs to be done, how well it should be done, get regular feedback about results, and work collectively to improve. More simply, that means asking and answering the questions What are we trying to do?, How well are we doing it?, and How can we be more effective? Thats performance management.  We are certainly not alone in focusing on measuring and managing performance. It is nearly universal in the private sector. Student achievement testing has exerted a profound impact on public education and foundations and funders are increasingly insisting non-profits measure and manage their outcomes.  Cities across the country have developed innovative and iterative models to measure and manage performance. The CompStat model that originated in police agencies in Boston, New York and Los Angeles has had wide influence in law enforcement. CityStat in Baltimore applied performance measurement and management to a wider range of municipal services and has also been widely embraced by innovative city governments. There are now sophisticated data visualization portals to capture and convey goals and outcomes. Baltimore, Boston, Louisville and Los Angeles each have municipal performance management programs and associated, including web sites that serve as dashboards or scoreboards to publicly report results. Locally, Santa Monicas Sustainable City Plan and Sustainable City Report Card have been used as models by numerous cities throughout the U.S. as they developed and implemented similar performance management systems. Since 2012, Santa Monicas Cradle to Career Initiative has established cross departmental and interagency projects to improve outcomes for kindergarten readiness and teen mental health. Since 2014, over 35 cities have requested guidance on how to implement a local government wellbeing framework to guide performance management and outcome-oriented governance. Towards that end, Santa Monica has been asked by Bloomberg Philanthropies to co-sponsor a convening of twelve pilot cities across the United States to begin replication of the wellbeing framework and index work. The process of measuring and managing performance starts with defining clear, meaningful and measurable objectives and targets about what we want to achieve. For example, progress towards an affordable and diverse community may be gauged through increasing the number of deed-restricted affordable housing in Santa Monica. One way to tell how well the community is thriving may be the number of Santa Monica residents who feel that they can count on their neighbors. These are metrics for some of our Strategic Goals. We will also create meaningful and measurable goals and metrics for day-to-day City operations.  Once the goals are set, data will be captured, analyzed and shared. By looking at data, we can see if we are making progress towards our intended outcomes or figure out a new approach. Well make decisions or recommendations based on what weve learned. And, being clear about what we want to achieve as well as our actual achievements helps everyone know how they contribute. Plus, we can show our results to the community and celebrate successes.  It should be emphasized that while we are being more systematic and comprehensive in this effort, we are certainly not starting from scratch. Our Police Department uses performance management to track, solve and prevent crime. Our Big Blue Bus uses key performance indicators (a widely used term in the private sector) to manage on-time performance and other results. Every department uses data and metrics in day-to-day management. What we are building, however, is a citywide culture and comprehensive approach to measure what matters most and make it transparent to the community. That is the future of local public sector accountability.  The next steps in the evolution of our performance management practices include creating a coherent path forward, working with departments on mapping operations to existing and proposed dimensions, defining key terms, finding examples from other cities as well as from within the organization, identifying early adopters or pilots, building staff teams, and securing the resources needed to successfully implement a performance management system. The Citys new Chief Performance Officer, who will soon be joined by the Citys first Chief Data Officer, the Office of Civic Wellbeing, and the Finance Department will spearhead this.  How does what we do influence civic wellbeing and sustainability?Cities must leverage all of the data they routinely collect about residents, services, and programs in order to establish policy recommendations, develop programs, and gauge their impact. Every City plan or policy is informed by stakeholder input, which may come through formal and informal planning processes, surveys and data collection, stakeholder meetings, Boards, Commissions, and Task Forces, neighborhood associations, comments to the Council, social media, and other avenues.  While Santa Monica already uses a diversity of data sources to understand community needs and the efficacy of programs and services, creating a framework and evolving our performance management system creates an opportunity to collect and use data in a more focused manner. Future feedback and data points will be viewed and evaluated within the context of the Citys framework. This organizational evolution starts by developing a cohesive framework that is meaningful to community, Council, and staff. With a framework in place, we can align programs and services to specific dimensions and demonstrate how Council priorities and municipal operations further organizational goals. Staff has already begun mapping work to the wellbeing dimensions and creating metrics, first with the Strategic Goals. For example, investing in a new homeless multidisciplinary street team that can provide field-based medical, mental health, substance abuse, and housing placement services to a specific group of 25 historically high-users of emergency services is a pro-active way to address how homelessness impacts the quality and access of shared and community spaces, or place. We will use data from multiple sources to assess if this intervention reduces the number of arrests, citations, field interviews, and use of emergency medical services by the cohort as well as the cost-effectiveness of the model.  The FY 2017-19 budget will begin to transition the way the City communicates about its programs and services. To do this, there will be some changes in the budget book.          City Managers Message: will introduce the civic wellbeing framework and discuss the larger context of ongoing citywide change projects.          Framework Section (new): will provide an in-depth introduction to the framework, defining the wellbeing dimensions, connections to strategic goals, and application to citywide work.          Departmental Summaries: will include department projects and operations that support the civic wellbeing dimensions and sustainability. This will replace the goals, objectives, and benchmarks in the current department summary section.  The Framework Section will also function as a standalone document that well update throughout the year as we refine project and program alignment to dimensions and develop metrics. This will be our first step in establishing a performance management system through which well better be able to evaluate whether we are meeting the communitys needs.  The projects shown in Departmental summaries will highlight the Citys ongoing, core functions  like the provision of water, plan check review, fleet management  and link them to the framework outcomes of improving wellbeing in Santa Monica.  Structuring a budget around the achievement of large- scale policy outcomes is occurring in communities across the United States. Outcome-based budgeting, or performance-based budgeting, aligns budgetary decisions with the achievement of large-scale outcomes. In recent years, cities such as Richmond, VA, Baltimore, MD, and Lincoln, NE have adopted outcome-based budgeting strategies, as well as over 45% of state governments. This approach focuses on the use of long-range budgeting to ensure that budget priorities and requests connect with the achievement of policy outcomes. Developing a framework will allow the Santa Monica to develop a budget that includes detailed metrics which will showcase the work of departments in achieving major outcomes for the residents of the city. Like all sustainable changes in organizational culture, building a comprehensive performance management system in Santa Monica will be an incremental process which will take a number of years. Nor does it operate in isolation from complimentary efforts to align budget with performance (performance budgeting); greater investment in training and workforce skill development; pursuing data-driven decision-making; and investing in the technology and workspaces that support these efforts.  Creating and using a framework will help City staff see how their work advances a citywide strategy and know what is expected of them.  And, the overall effort of aligning and evaluating our efforts will help staff manage to consistent priorities, offer more effective public services, improve community and organizational outcomes, and produce more meaningful and integrated communication about the Citys work. ", "background": "In June 2011, Council adopted Santa Monicas first Biennial Budget, covering fiscal years 2011-13. Biennial budgets have been prepared for FY13-15, FY15-17, and are being developed for FY17-19 and will reflect the current five-year financial forecast, adopted plans and policies, and current areas of focus or emerging issues.  Also in 2011 the City instituted a new management system that used departmental goals, objectives, and service benchmarks to set targets and measure results. Work efforts were reported to the City Manager on a quarterly basis; department heads were held accountable for results. This approach facilitated detailed tracking and reporting of departmental achievements but did not connect work to broad organizational or community goals. The proposed framework would create and elevate broad organizational goals and create a baseline for future performance management strategies and metrics.  ", "summary": "Santa Monica has a long reputation of being a progressive city, dedicated to providing a wide range of first-class services to our residents.  Since the 2015 creation of the Wellbeing Index, Santa Monica is also seen as a national leader in reshaping how we think about the purpose of local public services. It builds on our two decade commitment to setting citywide sustainability goals and the Citys widely-recognized pioneering innovations. Every one of our traditional services (policing, fire protection, street lighting, libraries etc.) originated in the challenges of particular times and places. They have eventually become to be almost taken for granted as what cities do. Now, in a changing world, our Wellbeing work re-focuses the public sector not on what we do, but why we do it  which in turn allows us to better guide decision-making for improving what we do. This is particularly important in the context of efficient and effective use of public resources. Santa Monica has thrived by providing an ever-expanding range of services. We were the first in the nation to adopt a formal Sustainability Plan  which has spawned an ambitious and widely-admired work to reduce pollution, conserve resources and promote environmental health. We secured foundation funding to create the Annenberg Community Beach House, a unique public amenity with a beachside pool, art gallery and multi-purpose public spaces along with a food concession and access to the shore for the disabled. We are augmenting our partnership with the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District, Santa Monica College and community non-profits to foster a successful Cradle to Career pathway for children raised in Santa Monica. These and many, many more unique initiatives reflect a commitment to respond to community needs and desires. What can be obscured in this growth of services is the ultimate purpose  and the basis for measuring the value and effectiveness of those services. Government grows  but how can we measure the benefit to the community? The Wellbeing Project gives Santa Monica a ground-breaking opportunity to do just that  to refocus our efforts not on expanding services but on producing better  and clearer --results. We do that not by measuring what we do, but what outcomes we achieve.  The Wellbeing work illuminates some salient questions that can be overlooked if we take our service model for granted:        What are the most important dimensions of community and individual wellbeing?       How are people doing?       What are we trying to achieve and for whom?        How well are we succeeding?       How can we both improve services and achieve better results? We want to know how residents and our community are doing so we can shape public services and participate as partners in efforts that improve civic wellbeing. Funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies and aided by a team of experts, staff and community leaders developed a pioneering methodology to measure wellbeing, called the Wellbeing Index. It measures five areas of civic wellbeing called dimensions - community, place, learning, health, and economic opportunity.  Augmented by a sixth dimension, called outlook, measuring resident wellbeing on an individual level. These dimensions will be adjusted to include other community values such as environmental sustainability and good governance. These adaptations will be developed in partnership with RAND and other experts in order to assure fidelity to the best practices and current research. Our goal is to establish a clear and consistent framework for what the City does based on the why of promoting civic wellbeing and sustainability for our residents and community.   Staff is working to create an organization-wide framework that would serve as the foundation for a new performance management system. An effective performance measurement and management system is based on knowing what you are seeking to achieve so you can measure your efforts to achieve it. The Council has played a catalytic role in this effort by identifying the five Strategic Goals and supporting the development of the Wellbeing Index.  This year, we will look at the work we are already doing in relation to the identified dimensions of Wellbeing and the goals of the Sustainable City Plan. This effort to identify and align what we do with the outcomes we are trying to achieve will help shape the overall framework for performance management. Based on that framework, we will identify key SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant & Timely) metrics and begin to collect and analyze data to determine how well we are meeting our goals, to give us ideas about how to be more effective at what we do, and inform decision-making.  Advancing organizational culture change and building a comprehensive performance management system in Santa Monica will be an incremental process which will take a number of years. Evolving the Citys management system will be an iterative process; including a new, cohesive framework in the FY17-19 budget will be the first outwardly visible step.  As the policy makers for the City, the City Council is the driving force for identifying and clarifying the outcomes that matter most for civic wellbeing and sustainability. The Council is charged with oversight on the performance of city government to achieve those outcomes. Moreover, it is axiomatic that all successful organizational culture change is dependent on consistent leadership from the leaders of that organization. "}, "title": " Use of a Framework for Performance Management and Data-Driven Decision Making", "Sponsors": null, "recommendations": [""], "Department": "City Manager's Office, Administration"}]], "July 11 5:30 PM": [[], [], [], [{"title": null}], [], [{"Department": "2: Special Agenda Items", "Category": "02.

CERP now includes most types of hardware purchased from multiple sources, and staff computer systems are generally purchased from one contracted vendor, through a master purchase agreement. Installation services and purchase agreementThe City has historically had one vendor that provided the computer hardware, and subcontracted the installation and warranty services to a separate service provider. Under the Citys previous agreement with HP, staff would purchase the equipment from HP and HP would oversee that the installation services were delivered in accordance with City requirements. In cases where the subcontractor did not meet the Citys performance expectations, the City could request for HP to assign a new service provider. This occurred in one case, under the previous contract, where the service provider did not perform according to contracted expectations and the City asked HP to assign a new subcontractor to provide the service. In preparation for the termination of the Citys agreement with HP, staff conducted a competitive bid process in January 2017, seeking a new hardware vendor and services provider for a new multi-year agreement. Unlike the previous bid processes which consistently yielded bids directly from hardware vendors (HP, Dell and Lenovo) who subcontracted their services for installation and warranty repairs, this years process yielded bids directly from the service providers. These service providers partnered with major hardware manufacturers (HP, Dell and Lenovo), submitting bids to provide both the installation services as well as to resell computer hardware from their hardware partners. Under this scenario, the City could enter into one master agreement with the installation service provider for both the purchase of services and hardware purchases; however, this is not ideal as it would bundle the service and hardware together, without the flexibility to change one without the other. This would mean that the City would not have the flexibility to change service providers, if not performing according to contracted expectations, without losing the ability to purchase computer equipment.  It is for the above reasons that staff recommends separating the service and purchase components into two separate contracts; 1) with the installation and deployment services provider; and 2) with the hardware manufacturer for the purchase of hardware and warranty coverage.  Service and hardware selectionFour bids were received through the current bidding process. Bids were evaluated for adherence to service level and compatibility requirements, as defined in the RFP. Staff evaluated the services proposals, with a primary focus on exceptional service delivery. The goal was to identify a firm that would provide white-glove computer replacement and installation services, at an affordable price. The chosen vendor would provide an enhanced customer service experience, by ensuring that new computer systems are setup promptly and properly, minimizing disruption to City operations.  The primary focus for selecting the hardware, was to select hardware that would be compatible with City standards, that could help promote mobility through sleek, lightweight, yet powerful mobile hardware, and has built-in security features and safeguards to address current mobile security concerns. This is in alignment with the Citys Total Workplace Initiative, whose goal is to cultivate an environment where staff can work securely from any device, in any location via wireless access and through web-based applications.  Staff anticipates that over the next four-year replacement cycle, approximately 80% of the Citys desktop computers will be replaced with laptops and tablets. In support of this mobile technology, the City has continued to implement web-based applications, has been outfitting City facilities with secured wireless connectivity, and, through future computer replacements, will continue to increase deployment of mobile hardware to further support the Total Workplace Initiative.  Vendor/Consultant SelectionOn November 16, 2016, the City issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the purchase, installation, and maintenance of City desktop computer equipment. The RFP was posted on the Citys online bidding site and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press, in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provisions.

Proposals were submitted by the following firms: CoverageOne in partnership with Dell, Insight Public Sector in partnership with HP, GST in partnership with Lenovo and PCMG who did not partner with a hardware manufacturer. Responses to the RFP were reviewed by a selection panel of staff from the Information Services Department. Evaluation was based on the following selection criteria: cost of equipment and services, service deployment strategy, experience/technical competence, value added, stability and references, and sustainability practices. Staff then interviewed all service providers, including the hardware manufacturers. Based on this criteria and criteria in SMMC 2.24.072, staff recommends Insight Public Sector as the best bidder to provide computer replacement and installation services in accordance with the City specifications. Staff also recommends HP for the purchase of computer hardware. Insight Public Sector and HP were the lowest bidders, best meeting the Citys requirements for services and product quality. Insights proposed deployment strategy best aligned with the Citys expectation of white-glove service delivery, and Insight has had extensive experience managing similar engagements for the City Detroit in Michigan, Mesa Public Schools in Arizona, and Covina Valley Unified School District in California. Insight received praise from all three references for their exceptional service delivery, experience, and professionalism. HPs product line is compatible with City standards, promotes mobility through sleek, lightweight, yet powerful mobile hardware, and has a product line with built-in security features and safeguards to address current mobile security concerns. At this time, staff recommends awarding RFP #96 to Insight Public Sector for computer replacement and installation services and to HP for the purchase of computer equipment and warranty coverage. This would result in a four-year services agreement with Insight Public Sector in the amount of $389,000 and a four-year purchase order with HP for hardware and warranty coverage in the amount of $3,261,000. The combined total contract amount would not exceed $3,650,000. This proposed contract amount reflects the cost to refresh the Citys current inventory of systems, accounts for future growth estimated at 10% based on equipment purchase request trends, and accounts for increased hardware costs for laptop workstation-type setups, which are significantly more costly, as they require a docking station, extended monitor and keyboard/mouse (depending on the specific setup). Funding for equipment replacements has been set aside as part of CERP, and is available in the Information Technology Replacement and Services Fund. ", "background": "Unlike most city governments that purchase computer equipment on a \"pay as you go\" basis, Santa Monica installs, supports and maintains the City's computer technology under a centralized purchasing program, the Computer Equipment Replacement Program (CERP). CERP was established to standardize the Citys technology, as well as ensure that computer equipment is properly maintained and replaced regularly, to remain compliant with modern technology requirements. Currently, the Information Services Department (ISD) manages approximately 2,100 desktop computers, laptops and tablets, 300 auxiliary computer monitors, 300 printers, 350 servers, various network equipment and all enterprise software. Funding for future replacement of technology included in CERP is established at the time of purchase, and includes the purchase price plus an annual depreciation cost that will fund its replacement at the end of the life cycle. These funds are set aside in the Computer Technology Replacement and Services Fund and are used to replace computer hardware, generally on a four-year cycle.  In February 2013 (Attachment A), Council authorized a four-year agreement with HP (#9710 CCS) in an amount not to exceed $1,600,000, for the purchase of desktop computer equipment, installation services to refresh all end-of-life systems, four-year warranty for product replacement, and on-site maintenance support.

SMO is located on 227 acres of land, bordered on three sides by busy arterial streets and residential neighborhoods, two of which are in the City of Los Angeles. The Airport Campus consists of 187 acres of land for aviation activities and 40 acres for non-aviation purposes such as park spaces, educational facilities, art studios, and Airport Avenue  which is the focus of this design effort. Airport Avenue is a two-lane road that provides a single travel lane and bicycle sharrows in each direction and runs east to west between 23rd Street/Walgrove Avenue and Bundy Drive. It is also the main connector roadway between the Santa Monica Airport and the surrounding communities.  The Report divided Airport Avenue into four segments based on the existing character of the street and highlighted the deficiencies of each segment. Two phases were developed for each segment to remedy the deficiencies. The Report envisioned Airport Avenue as a pedestrian and bicycle friendly corridor by reallocating some of the existing space allotted for vehicular travel and opening it up for multi-modal uses. Staff reviewed both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 proposed improvements and determined that Phase 2 best meets the future vision of the Airport Campus. Both phases are illustrated in the Report. Phase 1 included only pedestrian improvements and would not create sufficient space for the bicycle path. Thus staff determined that implementing Phase 2 would best fulfill the communitys needs and visioning goals. Phase 2 outlines full scale, long-term improvements that would result in multiple enhancements. Enhancements include construction of full-width ADA compliant sidewalks; a two-way bike path on the north side of the street; installation of new pedestrian oriented lighting and fiber optic cable network; installation of new parkway trees; construction of new crosswalks and pedestrian amenities; replacement of the existing water main with a new water main; and pavement improvements to the existing street. The proposed enhancements, which were developed with community input through the Council directed visioning process, will transform the busy Airport Avenue corridor into a multi-modal corridor with improved safety for pedestrians and cyclists.  Environmental AnalysisThe Airport Avenue Improvement Project is categorically exempt from CEQA pursuant to Sections 15301, 15302, 15303, and 15304 of CEQA Guidelines. Section 15301 provides Class 1 exemption for the minor alteration of existing public or private facilities involving negligible or no expansion of use. Section 15302 provides Class 2 exemption for the replacement of existing utility systems, involving negligible expansion of use. Section 15303 provides Class 3 exemption for the construction of new small structures. Section 15304 provides Class 4 exemption of minor public or private alterations in the condition of land and/or vegetation. The project would make improvements to existing Airport Avenue, which will include new curbs/ramps, lighting, a retaining wall and landscape, as well as replacement of existing water main, to create a better pedestrian and bicycle environment. Therefore, the project qualifies as a Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, and Class 4 exemption. In addition, none of the exceptions specified in Section 15300.2 of CEQA Guidelines would apply that would preclude the use of this CEQA exemption  The project site is not located in a sensitive environment, the project will not have a significant effect on the environment, the project would not damage scenic resources, the project would not be located on a hazardous waste site, and the project would not cause a change to a historical resource. Therefore, this project is categorically exempt from CEQA. Consultant SelectionOn February 23, 2017, the City issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for Engineering Design Services for the Airport Avenue Improvement Project to implement the Phase 2 recommendations of the Airport Non-Aviation Land Component Final Report.  The RFP was posted on the Citys online bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code Provision. A total of 52 vendors downloaded the RFP and six firms responded (Arup North America Ltd., KPFF Consulting Engineers, Cannon Consulting, Huitt-Zollars, Inc., Tetra Consulting Inc., KOA Corporation).  Proposals were reviewed by a selection committee consisting of staff from the Civil Engineering and Airport divisions. The committee shortlisted three firms (KPFF Consulting Engineers, Cannon Consulting and KOA Corporation) and conducted interviews with the shortlisted firms on May 22, 23 and 24, 2017.  Evaluation was based on the following selection criteria: experience; references; proposed project work plan; proposed project team; creativity; demonstrated technical competence and understanding of the project scope; and cost. Based on this criteria and criteria in SMMC 2.24.073, staff recommends Cannon Consulting as the best qualified firm to provide engineering design services, for an amount not to exceed $499,233 (including 10% contingency). Cannon Consulting demonstrated extensive knowledge and experience with similar projects in the cities of Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria, and South Pasadena. Cannon Consulting also demonstrated through past projects its ability to offer experienced design teams that can complete high quality project designs in an expeditious manner and at competitive hourly rates. Next StepThe anticipated timeline for the design phase of the project is approximately 6 months (August 2017 to January 2018).

Continued Items", "body": {"": "Executive Summary This report presents for adoption the final Downtown Community Plan (DCP), which provides a comprehensive vision to guide the evolution of Santa Monicas Downtown until 2030. Based on the direction of the Land Use and Circulation Element to develop a Specific Plan for Downtown, the DCP establishes a balanced framework of policies, standards and actions that support the various roles that Downtown plays as a residential neighborhood, a regional job center, an international tourist destination and a community living room.Spanning nearly six years in development, work on the DCP has been extensive and far-reaching, touching thousands of people who live, work or visit the Downtown. Throughout this timeframe, people have followed the trajectory of this comprehensive planning document through multiple versions and have passionately advocated for a range of outcomes that speak to the diversity of perspectives within our community. The Final DCP is the culmination of this engaging dialogue, and a record of the Citys effort to balance the myriad priorities of a community that aspires to achieve the best outcome for our central heart of commercial, cultural and entertainment activity. There has largely been support for the Plans overall approach. However, a plan of this significance inevitably highlights diverse views on the shape and scope of future new development in our community, including those who argue that the plan would allow too much growth in our Downtown and those who maintain it would overly restrict the supply of new housing. Beyond those philosophical differences, three specific issues bear particular attention that are highlighted for Council consideration in Chapter 3 of this report.The DCP has been endorsed by the Planning Commission, the Housing Commission, the Recreation and Parks Commission, the Arts Commission, the Landmarks Commission, the Architectural Review Board and the Social Services Commission. In particular, the Planning Commission held six meetings to take extensive public testimony and review in detail the final draft released on April 12th of this year. Staff has endorsed virtually all of the Planning Commissions recommendations and incorporated them into our recommendations to the Council in this report. The Commission also carefully reviewed the Final Environmental Impact Report and recommends its certification by the Council.   This report provides a synopsis of the final regulatory and policy framework that will guide all future public and private investment in the Downtown, and provides detail on Plan highlights surrounding housing production, historic preservation, the creation of public spaces, and mobility changes. It describes in general terms the six-year outreach effort to bend Plan concepts towards agreement, and highlights several challenging spotlight issues that remain for the Council to weigh-in on. The Plan also includes an Implementation and Monitoring Plan, which involves sequencing recommended changes over time and deploying resources to the areas of greatest need. Importantly, the Monitoring Plan includes a cap on development as a measure to control the pace of change and ensure that it is in accordance with LUCE and DCP goals.Since the release of the Draft DCP in April 2016, staff has conducted or attended over 50 public meetings to present the Plan. Feedback, comments and questions have been generated from neighborhood groups, individuals, business organizations, trade professionals, and nearly all of the Citys Boards and Commissions, including six recent hearings before the Planning Commission.  The Final Plan has been modified based on this input, as summarized in this report and detailed in an attached list.The Downtown Community Plan is organized for readability and visual access to the key concepts that make up the Plan. The Plan is composed of 6 Chapters and an Appendix. The following summarizes the Plans six chapters: Chapter 1: IntroductionIntroduces the vision for Downtown Santa Monica, and provides background for the development of the principles that guide the Plans goals and policies. This chapter is useful to the reader who wishes to understand the larger planning context and anticipated outcomes over the 20-year time horizon of the Downtown Community Plan.  Chapter 2A: Downtown DistrictsThis chapter introduces the Downtowns seven land use districts and provides information on the communitys priorities for benefits that would stem from new developments. The process and structure of the DCP entitlement system is also described in this chapter. Chapter 2B: Community, Culture, Prosperity Describes the Plans overarching commitment to developing a long-term, sustainable community in the Downtown. Provides detail on strategies for increasing housing production, and maintaining and enhancing Downtowns existing diversity of businesses and economic health into the future. This substantive chapter also outlines the importance of building upon the existing public art and event program to nurture cultural activities, including an anchor museum, live music and performances, theater and cinema and other creative enterprises. Chapter 2C: Historic PreservationHistory plays a central role in Downtowns character. This chapter underlines the importance of Downtowns historic resources, which includes City Designated historic resources and potential historic resources, and describes the protections that are provided in the DCP to retain important or character-defining buildings, as well as incentives that make adaptive reuse an attractive option to redevelopment.  Chapter 2D: Pathways and Public SpacesSidewalks form the framework for pedestrian movement through the City, often to public places for gathering, recreation or entertainment. This chapter strengthens the relationship between sidewalks and public spaces with guidance for design, orientation, and access. Importantly, this chapter outlines strategies for increasing public space offerings Downtown. Chapter 2E: Supportive Infrastructure This chapter examines the condition of existing utilities in the Downtown and provides strategies for implementing improvements necessary for realizing the Plans vision and supporting the projected increase in residents. Chapter 3: Access and MobilityPeople get to - and move throughout - the Downtown in many different ways. This chapter looks at Downtown circulation as a network of interconnected parts and defines a coordinated set of actions related to design, operations, management and innovation. These include changes to both private property and property owned and managed by the City of Santa Monica.  Chapter 4: Standards and RegulationsFor property owners and designers, this Chapter defines the standards regulating site changes for new and renovated buildings. Standards and requirements outline allowable density, building height, modulation, open space and sidewalk widths.  Chapter 5: Design GuidelinesInstructive design guidelines provide a framework for high-quality urban design, including building design and public open space. Chapter 6: Implementation ActionsOutlines the funding and financing options for implementing the Downtown Community Plan, and provides a comprehensive phasing recommendation for the combined actions. This chapter also describes the development cap and a monitoring program that will allow the City and community to evaluate the impact of Plan policies. AppendixThe build-out analysis developed for the Environmental Impact Report provides an understanding of what is likely to change over the next 20 years (Attachment D). This information is also captured in the interactive website: www.smgov.net/Departments/PCD/SeeDowntown2030/  Consistent with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and CEQA Guidelines, a Program Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was prepared for the DCP. The Program EIR analyzed the potential environmental effects associated with the DCP and identified mitigation measures necessary to reduce significant impacts.  Additionally, the Program EIR analyzes alternatives to the DCP, including a No Project Alternative and a Reduced Project (Tier 2 only) Alternative.  The Final EIR concludes that although there would be significant and unavoidable impacts, the DCP (with 3.2 million sf cap) would achieve the goals of No Net New PM Peak Hour Trips by 2030, and would reduce per capita vehicles miles traveled (VMT) and greenhouse gas emissions.", "other": "The Final Downtown Community Plan (Attachment A) presents a vision for Downtown Santa Monica that includes a prioritization for over 2,500 new housing units, as well as new public spaces, a further diversification of art and cultural offerings, a prominent role for historic preservation, and a multi-faceted approach to enhancing Downtowns pedestrian environment through building setbacks and improved streetscapes, to name but a few. Designed to be a relatively lower-scale 5-7 story Downtown, the DCP envisions that change will happen incrementally and be accompanied by infrastructure investments, including enhancements to the mobility network, that support the needs of a growing population.  Refining the LUCE VisionThe 2010 LUCE defined newly expanded boundaries for Downtown. The LUCE brought in all areas west of Lincoln Boulevard into the planning boundary to increase Downtowns footprint and to concentrate desired housing, jobs and community-serving uses near the terminus of the Expo light rail. Noting the inherent challenges faced by Downtown to maintain Santa Monicas small-town vibrancy and flavor, the LUCE directed the City and community to develop a Specific Plan to determine the appropriate range of building heights in the district and address the need for open space, affordable and workforce housing, pedestrian access from areas south of the Downtown core, the linkages from Downtown to the Beach and the incorporation of the Downtown Light Rail Station into the fabric of the Downtown. (LUCE Policy D14.1) After six years of Plan development, outreach and public discussions, the DCP has struck a balance to meet the challenges identified in the LUCE. The DCP creates the conditions for a lively pedestrian-oriented mix of uses and activities, including new housing options that are complemented by services and public spaces to create a complete neighborhood. It further strengthens Downtowns identity by safeguarding City designated historic resources and potential historic resources through a comprehensive preservation approach, and marries this to the creation of new landmarks that will spring from flexible development standards that inspire creativity and innovation at a scale that is consistent with Santa Monicas contemporary urban form. Lastly, the DCP continues to rely on the concept that pedestrians come first in Downtown Santa Monica. Addressing the full range of mobility in the Downtown relies on building on the investments already in place and strategic investment in infrastructure and programs to the meet the transportation needs of Downtown. As a comprehensive document, the DCP provides substantial policy guidance on all of the elements mentioned above, such that the Council and its Boards and Commissions will have a framework for making decisions about public investments, or judging the merit of proposals that are submitted by private individuals who wish to effect any manner of change Downtown. Significantly, the DCP also provides a suite of actions that the City itself will use to develop departmental and interagency workplans around infrastructure upgrades, public space enhancement, economic development, historic preservation, and mobility. These actions, implemented in coordination with a monitoring program that includes a cap on the volume of development evaluated under the Plans EIR, will guide city leaders to carefully steward the evolution of Downtown in a manner that is consistent with the long-term goals of the community for sustainability, resilience and well-being. This report summarizes the core components of the Downtown Community Plan and provides information on the substantive outreach process, as well as input from the Planning Commission and other Boards and Commission that have weighed-in on the final draft. For clarity, the report is organized into the following three chapters: 1.     THE DOWNTOWN COMMUNITY PLAN 2.     PLAN DEVELOPMENT AND FEEDBACK 3.     COUNCIL CONSIDERATIONS A.   Urban Design and Land Use StrategyFor the past century, Downtown Santa Monicas built environment has responded to various eras of change. From its infancy as a crossroads of commerce and civic life, to its present day role as bustling local hangout and job/tourist center Downtowns buildings stand as a record of human endeavor, and as a reflection of the zoning standards that each subsequent generation implemented to guide the urban form priorities of the day. This incremental approach is responsible for the great diversity of building heights Downtown, which range from one-story brick and mortar structures to taller twenty-one-story glass and steel buildings.  The DCP acknowledges the interplay between the old and new as a necessary ingredient to Downtowns authenticity, and presents an urban design strategy to safeguard the identifiable historic core within the Bayside Conservation District, and transfer unused development potential to the areas immediately served by the Expo Light Rail. The 5-7 story height profile proposed by the DCP is framed by 4-story transition zones that gradually reduce height and scale at Downtowns outer edges where it abuts the residential neighborhoods of Wilmont and Mid-City, and where views of the Pacific Ocean open up on Ocean Avenue. The development standards for the Plans six land use districts (Bayside Conservation, Neighborhood Village, Transit Adjacent, Lincoln Transition, Wilshire Transition, Ocean Transition) derive from the urban design strategy and provide equilibrium between the communitys desire to protect the historic scale of Downtowns central walking area centered on the Third Street Promenade with the need to accommodate additional residential and commercial activities in areas that are regionally connected by transit.  Land UseDowntowns vibrancy is attributed to its unique mix of shops, restaurants, offices, institutions, health and well-being centers, entertainment venues, markets, apartments, and dozens of other offerings that are used daily by locals, employees and visitors. As the expanded boundaries of Downtown begin to transition into a mixed-use environment, the DCP provides a logical structure for regulating land uses in a way that is complimentary to the urban design strategy by directing the most intensive pedestrian-oriented uses to the historic core and transit area, and limiting the presence of larger more regionally-sized commercial uses adjacent to residential areas. This framework supports the DCPs Land Use Regulations, which are finely-tuned to balance the Downtowns various roles as urban neighborhood, regional job center and visitor destination. Urban Form and Building DesignSanta Monica is renowned as a center of innovation and creativity, often leading the region - if not the nation  on issues of sustainability, community enrichment and urban policy. These practices are woven throughout many adopted City documents, such as the Zoning Ordinance, that influence building design both in our commercial areas as well as in our residential neighborhoods. In Downtown, the City has the opportunity to embody these principles in a new urban typology that celebrates architectural expression through flexible design standards. The DCP departs from the rigid formulas of the past several decades that have produced wedding cake buildings, and instead employs a suite of percentage-based modulation requirements that allow for an architectural concept to drive building design. These standards, which ensure a consistent pedestrian-scaled streetwall, interior access to light and air, and communal open spaces for building residents, provide designers with a comfortable canvas for exemplary architecture while empowering planners and reviewing bodies with sufficient criteria to evaluate the merit of individual projects. In response to comments received from the design community during the Planning Commissions deliberations on the draft DCP, avenues for alternative compliance or modifications to standards along with strategic exemptions from standards for single lot projects were added to the Planning Commissions recommended changes. The Architectural Review Board (ARB) discussed the Downtown Community Plan at both their June 5, 2017 and June 19, 2017 meetings and generally endorsed the urban design strategy and urban form approach. There was a robust exchange of ideas including discussion of design standards, modulation standards and design guidelines, the Bayside Conservation District and attention to potential historic resources and Landmark properties, open space provisions, as well as other aspects of the plan. The ARB Subcommittee also made many specific recommendations, identifying conflicts within the plan that needed clarification, and highlighting technical architectural items to be addressed with greater precision.  These items have been addressed in the staff-recommended Addenda (Attachment C). The ARB is generally supportive of the Downtown Community plan presented.  The ARB had a particular interest and concern regarding the modulation standards and were focused on ensuring the adopted standards do not prevent or hinder innovation and/or excellence in design.  To that end, the ARB would like to support the following implementation actions:          Add to Chapter 6, Implementation Actions a report on whether the development standards have resulted in desired outcomes. The change is recommended on Page 249, Item 5A, Enforcement of Project Entitlements, Review the design quality of downtown project to ensure diverse design typologies, innovation and quality design.         The Board strongly endorses the use of resources such as the Downtown Santa Monica Inc. Ambassador Program and outreach to private property owners regarding possible management partnerships to ensure successful outdoor spaces are incorporated into existing and new projects.         The Board also endorses the action to develop a Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District (NCOD) in the Bayside Conservation District (BSCD). Staff has added the ARBs proposed implementation action to the staff-recommended Addenda. Since the June ARB meetings, the Boards DCP subcommittee submitted a recommendation to add a special alternative stepback option for all Districts. The proposal would allow forms, geometries, and skins such as layered facades and brise-soleils that do not fit the modulation standards but generally conform to the intent for three-dimensional design and to ensure light and air into buildings and down to the street to be considered on a case-by-case basis through discretionary review. To this point, staff notes that the Plan already allows for architectural projections beyond the building frontage line for 2/3 of the faade and therefore, believes the forms and geometries contemplated by the ARB subcommittee would be accommodated within the Plans allowable projections.  The Downtown Community Plan is a Housing PlanThe Downtown Community Plans primary responsibility is to respond to the direction of the LUCE to encourage the growth of the residential population Downtown. This strategic land use emphasis is intended to accommodate the unmet demand for new housing in Santa Monica by directing the production of over 2,500 new units to an area that is rich with public transportation options and where higher densities can support a more sustainable development pattern. The primacy of housing development is highlighted in the DCP by policy and Plan standards that provide incentives to encourage the production of new housing units, both market-rate and affordable to people of lower incomes. The Housing Commission supports the DCPs approach to housing production. Housing Incentives         Floor Area Ratio (FAR) Bonus: housing projects have access to an additional 0.5 FAR bonus over commercial projects of a similar size.         Height Bonus on Lincoln and Wilshire Boulevards: housing projects on Lincoln and Wilshire Boulevard may achieve the maximum permitted height of the districts, whereas commercial projects are subject to a 10-foot reduction from the maximum permitted height.         PC RECOMMENDED: Process Incentives: entitlements for housing projects enjoy higher development review thresholds than their commercial counterparts. o       Housing projects up to 60,000 square feet (on lots no greater than 15,000 square feet) throughout the Downtown shall be processed through an Administrative Approval. o       Tier 3 housing projects up to 90,000 square feet in the Transit Adjacent District shall be processed through a Development Review Permit. Affordable Housing RequirementsIn addition to the housing incentives that are provided in the DCPs Standards and Regulations, affordable housing production will be stimulated by new requirements for Tier 2 and non-negotiated Tier 3 projects. These requirements were determined based upon feasibility analyses prepared by HR&A (Attachment I).         Uniform Affordable Housing Requirement by Height: the DCP proposes a modified framework for affordable housing, compared to existing regulations, that requires a single percentage of on-site or off-site housing, depending on the proposed height of the project.          Increased On-site Affordable Housing Requirements: the DCP requires a greater percentage of deed-restricted affordable units than currently required.         Augmented Off-Site Affordable Housing Requirements: projects that wish to satisfy their Affordable Housing requirement off-site of the market-rate project will be subject to an even higher percentage of deed-restricted affordable units than the on-site equivalent. Based on the Planning Commissions review of the DCP Affordable Housing proposal, the distance that an off-site project can be located from its related market-rate project has been expanded to anywhere within the Downtown, or within one-quarter mile of the market rate project.         Mandated Affordable Income Level Mix: based upon the proportionate household income levels in the Housing Element Regional Housing Needs Assessment and requirements of Proposition R, the revised DCP includes a new requirement to provide a mix of income levels within the total affordable units required for the project so that each project provides units affordable to extremely low, very low, low and moderate incomes. Exemptions for 100% Affordable Housing Projects         PC RECOMMENDED: Administrative Approval Threshold: 100% Affordable Housing projects up to 75 units may be approved administratively.         PC RECOMMENDED: Floor Area Ratio (FAR) Bonus: 100% Affordable housing projects in the Neighborhood Village have access to an additional 0.5 FAR bonus and 10 feet of additional height. The DCP projects an estimated minimum of 2,500 new units produced over the next 15-20 years, which represents a doubling of the residential population that emerged over the past three decades. Most of the new housing projects will include a healthy mix of unit sizes and affordability levels based on the DCPs policy direction and project requirements. It is important to note that 2,500 new units is a projection, not an absolute number, and could be increased upwards due to market forces that favor housing production over other land uses, such as commercial office or retail. The DCPs housing strategy and project requirements were reviewed by the Housing Commission at meetings on June 15, 2017 and June 20, 2017. The Housing Commission endorses most aspects of the DCPs housing approach including incentives for 100% affordable housing projects. However, the Housing Commission recommends that additional project or process requirements be contemplated further. Many of these recommendations include changes to proposed measures in the Plan including         Eliminating CUP requirement for SRO projects         Rejecting the process incentives for housing projects recommended by the Planning Commission         Prohibiting any offsite affordable housing within 500 feet of the I-10 freeway         Ensuring that the Housing Element Quantified Objective and Proposition R production requirements have been met before middle-income units (130%-180% AMI as indicated in DCP) could be considered in development agreement negotiations The inclusion of SRO projects as a permitted use is a change that will be reflected in the use table. The streamlined process for typical housing projects recommended by the Planning Commission was based on the need to create a clear and predictable process for housing projects as compared to commercial projects. To provide context to the location of offsite affordable housing, the Planning Commission discussed the limitation of residential uses within 500 feet of the I-10 freeway but did not impose any locational restrictions. Further, much of the Transit Adjacent district is within 500 feet of the I-10 freeway. Development agreement negotiations are conducted on a case-by-case basis so there would be no obligation to include any middle-income units. The Housing Commission also made several recommendations that extend beyond the scope of what has been in the public discourse or in proposals presented by staff or the community, including:         A graduated affordable housing requirement that escalates up to 35% based on allowable height and FAR thresholds         Eliminating any office or retail uses above the ground floor for new buildings, with exceptions for areas that the Council deems appropriate.         Applying project requirements (i.e. affordability mix and average bedroom factor) to offsite 100% affordable housing projects with an exemption from the requirements only if necessary to obtain other forms of public financing         Biennial review of DCP Affordable Housing and AHPP requirements to determine if new incentives or requirements should be instituted         Encouraging ground floor residential units to have a preference for low-income disabled persons and artists, subject to City Attorney review regarding any fair housing implications         Reviewing the entire AHPP now for consistency with Prop R income targeting and rent limits and revise the affordability requirements outside of Downtown based upon new feasibility studies similar to that conducted for the DCP         Increasing deed-restriction terms on affordable units from 55 years to the life of the project         Identifying publically-owned land as a potential resource to achieve affordable housing goals Staff appreciates the thoughtful detail that the Housing Commission put into their recommendations, some of which fall outside of the regulatory framework of the DCP in terms of deed restriction term limits and the framework of the AHPP.  Staff defers to Council on the subject of modified affordable housing requirements, but notes that a careful balance has been struck within the DCP between project requirements, fees, and process. Any recommendation must also be supported by the HR&A feasibility analysis. The elimination of office or retail space above the ground floor may appear attractive as a means to create housing projects but prohibiting office and retail above the ground floor must be carefully considered in balance with other uses that are vital to the Citys economy, social services network, or other important land uses that create a complete community.  The draft DCP proposes that offsite affordable housing projects must be owned in whole or part and operated by a non-profit housing provider. It is likely that these providers will seek public financing that will dictate the affordability requirements of the project, which is why the DCP exempts 100% affordable housing projects from the project requirements for Tier 2 and Tier 3 projects. However, there may be an instance where an offsite affordable housing project is completely privately financed. In this case, the project would still be required to comply with the definition of a 100% affordable housing project per Section 9.52.020.0050 of the Zoning Ordinance (25% of units affordable to 60% income households with remainder affordable to 80% income households). From a policy perspective, the net result is more affordable housing units and therefore, flexibility should be provided in how the offsite affordable housing is achieved. With respect to preference for artists, a new policy has also been included to explore accommodating artists within ground floor residential units provided the classifications do not result in unintended discriminatory impacts.  The DCP includes a monitoring requirement that would produce a report concurrent with the LUCE monitoring. The monitoring report would include data presented as part of the Proposition R annual reports. Staff does not support a requirement that the DCP affordable housing requirements be reviewed every two years as there may not be sufficient data points to inform such a study. The Preservation of Existing Buildings is Strongly SupportedPreserving the historic scale and character of Downtowns beloved walking areas is a central objective of the DCPs change strategy, which seeks to carefully retain many older structures that evoke nostalgia for Santa Monicas colorful past. The DCP improves upon previous historic preservation policies, and provides substantial support for adaptive reuse. A six-step approach outlines a variety of economic and technical incentives.  Adaptive Reuse IncentivesExemptions from standard development requirements have been added to the DCP that create economic and technical incentives for owners of properties identified as City Designated Historic Resources or as potential historic resources. Several examples include exemptions from development standards, such as parking, open space, and certain use regulations that would create barriers to adaptive reuse. It should be noted that other technical incentives are available such as the California Historical Building Code, which recognizes older buildings often need alternative methods in meeting fire and life safety requirements.  Protections for Historic ResourcesA new protection included in the DCP is an action to submit the Downtown Historic Resource Inventory (HRI) to the State Office of Historic Preservation, which would mean that all HRI-listed properties are considered presumptive historic resources under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). CEQA requires that exterior alterations to historic resources comply with the Secretary of the Interiors Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. If alterations are not in conformance or demolition is proposed, more detailed environmental review of the proposed project would be required, possibly including an Environmental Impact Report. Several new process changes are also included in the DCP to facilitate the conservation of City Designated Historic Resources and potential historic resources Downtown. These include modified demolition screening procedures that require Landmarks Commission review of demolition permits for structures more than 40 years old and clearance of the required 75-day waiting period before any Planning application can be submitted. This new procedure would serve as a means to identify potential historic resources prior to the submittal of an application, which would be complemented with an associated amendment to SMMC Article 8 (Building Regulations) to increase the lifespan for demolition applications. Future actions to support this process change include updating the Landmarks Ordinance to provide alternative pathways to designation and the creation of a Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District within the Bayside Conservation District to identify design features that provide visual identity to 2nd and 4th Streets. Special standards for the Bayside Conservation District include eliminating the open space requirements and relaxed modulation requirements in order to clearly define the traditional streetwall of 2nd and 4th Streets. The Landmarks Commission reviewed the DCPs approach to Historic Preservation at their June 12, 2017 meeting and supports the approach subject to the following recommended changes:         Specify possible funding sources for historic preservation         Assure that the existing provisions in the Municipal Code for expediting plan check occur in practice         Increase outreach and public education regarding historic preservation         Amend Policy HP2.4 to read, Adaptive reuse of older building should be considered for new construction and rehabilitation projects, when the scale, materials or method of construction evokes Downtowns history, and where the faade building contributes to a continuous streetscape.Staff supports the Landmarks Commissions recommendations and has added relevant changes to the recommended Addenda. Going forward, staff will continue to look for opportunities to realize existing incentives for historic preservation, and to help expand outreach on this subject.New Public and Open Spaces are Prioritized throughout DowntownBecause Downtown was largely developed as a commercial district it contains very few dedicated public spaces where groups can congregate. While many of the existing parks or public spaces that are utilized by Downtown residents and visitors are located nearby in other districts (e.g. Tongva Park, Palisades Park, Reed Park); within Downtown, only the public right of way, and places like the Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica Place, and the Santa Monica Main Library serve as Downtowns dedicated public open space offerings. Recognizing this, the community overwhelmingly identified the maintenance, enhancement or creation of public space as the #1 priority for Downtowns evolution.  The DCP looks at the public space network comprehensively, and acknowledges that a nuanced approach that involves both City and private interests must be considered. To this end, the Plan emphasizes the role that private development must play to add new public spaces to Downtown. The DCP identifies key sites where development has been proposed and where negotiations with property owners may yield significant public open space. Similarly, the Public Space plan includes existing publically-accessible spaces (POPs) that should be redesigned to promote better access and programming, perhaps incentivized with a small modicum of new floor area. Management and oversight of these spaces is paramount, and will require the involvement of City staff, DTSM and private property owners. Based on outreach, smaller scale public spaces such as pocket parks, courtyards and plazas are preferred over larger open spaces such as a central park or recreation fields. Additionally, the quality of Downtowns streetscapes is to be improved to emphasize their role as public spaces and the opportunity they provide to further pedestrianize the area through wider sidewalks, a larger more verdant urban forest, and street furnishings that would make the walking experience more enjoyable.  Private Open Space in Housing ProjectsA new feature of the DCPs zoning standards is the requirement for typical housing projects to provide on-site open space for residents use. Depending on the size of the project area, a project is required to dedicate 20-25% of the total lot area to courtyards, rooftop gardens, balconies and other open space types, and of this percentage one-quarter must be designed for communal use. Single-lot projects are exempt from these standards. The Recreation and Parks Commission (RPC) reviewed the DCPs Public Space approach at their December 15, 2016 meeting and subsequently provided a letter expressing unanimous support for the various approaches and policies surrounding the creation or enhancement of public open spaces Downtown. The RPC conditioned their support on several recommendations, including:          That the DCP maximize every opportunity to create open space, including true green space, courtyards, plazas and paseos;         That the DCP identify parcels that would be suitable for acquisition for open space use;         That the DCP include policies reflecting the need to work with private property owners to activate empty plazas;         That ground floor open space be included in all residential projects;         That projects subject to DAs provide substantial open space benefits and that property owners should be held accountable for maintaining open space amenities to the highest levels. Nearly all of the RPCs recommendations have been addressed and incorporated into the final draft DCP. The one exception is the recommendation to require ground floor open space, which was not integrated into the final plan as it would conflict with the broader urban design strategy to maintain a consistent streetwall at the ground floor. Encouraging Economic Vitality is Important to Downtowns FutureDowntown is a major employment center (approx. 25,000 jobs) and a revenue generator that supports the many programs, services and activities that residents citywide have come to enjoy. While constituting only 4.5% of the City, Downtowns generates over a third of the total sales tax revenues for Santa Monica, and another third of all hotel room revenues citywide. Additionally, fees collected from development to fund park maintenance, childcare programs, urban runoff projects, and transportation enhancements are largely drawn from projects located in Downtown. The combination of these elements has helped Downtown, and the city as a whole, weather challenging financial crises such as the Great Recession.  Given its prominence as Silicon Beach and a major tourist destination, one of Downtowns inherent tensions is the degree to which it caters to locals, employees and visitors alike. The challenge ahead is to ensure that it remains a place for everyone, and that opportunities for economic diversity are embraced. The DCP weaves together policies and standards that create a local business-friendly environment that can provide space for a broad mix of job opportunities in new and expanding industries whether they be creative office and co-working spaces, retail, dining and entertainment, or hospitality. The Promenade is further supported through a variety of exemptions from design standards to allow for greater flexibility, and through a change to several regulations that currently restrict uses. Going forward, an Action of the DCP is to work with Public Works and DTSM, Inc. on a Promenade improvement project to enhance its infrastructure, lighting and right-of-way features. In the course of outreach, a clear preference emerged to support the creative economy, and to expand opportunities for local entrepreneurialism with small and medium-sized businesses. To this end, the draft DCP includes a variety of changes from the zoning ordinance that are intended to reduce regulatory barriers for small businesses and typical changes of use. These include relaxed parking standards and less restrictive use regulations that ensure ground floor uses reflect the appropriate level of activity based on adjacency to residential uses.  The Downtown Santa Monica Inc. Board of Directors (DTSM) conducted a comprehensive review of the draft DCP and while there is agreement on many of the key approaches, there remains concern regarding the distribution of heights and densities across Downtown and the effect on housing production. DTSM highlighted six key recommendations for the Councils consideration:         Increase height and FAR in the BC and NV districts to 84 feet and FAR of 4.0 and to 60 feet and FAR of 2.75 for both sides of the Lincoln Transition district.         Provide streamlined process for granting flexibility from all aspects of retail space design and configuration standards to respond to the shifting retail environment.         Include a clear vision for a new state-of-the-art movie theater on the site of either Parking Structure #1 or #3.         Support for allowing ground floor office in midblock locations in the Neighborhood Village district as demand may not be sufficient to support retail in these locations resulting in vacancies detrimental to the neighborhood.         Include a clear statement on improvements to vehicle circulation with inclusion of a Vehicle Action Plan, similar in scope to Bike and Pedestrian Action Plans.         Consider flexibility in desired widths for sidewalk zones in order to accommodate space for outdoor dining. As discussed later in the report highlighting issues for Council consideration, policy options are presented to address housing production and ground floor office in Neighborhood Village midblock locations. The proposed heights and FARs in the Plan have been carefully crafted within the context of the urban design strategy to place the highest intensities closest to the Expo Station and to balance new development with the existing character of Downtown. DTSMs recommendations on a modification process for retail configuration are already included in the draft Plan. Language regarding support for movie theaters is also included in the Addenda. The sidewalk widths in the Plan are provided as conceptual illustrations and will be more comprehensively reviewed as part of the follow-up action to create a Downtown Streetscape Manual for how the public right-of-way is used and managed. As discussed in the following section, the Plan proposes a comprehensive Mobility approach that addresses improvements for all modes. A New Model for Mobility: Improving Today, Preparing for the FutureA new model for mobility includes making more transportation options attractive, convenient, affordable, and safer so that people feel they can circulate without driving alone. It is an evolution of how people get to Downtown, and how they experience traveling within Downtown. The creation of parking structures may have revived Downtown, Expo service has provided a new transit option, while the future is expected to include travel by driverless vehicles.  The park once, pedestrians first mantra has been a guiding tenet for the past 30 years in Downtown. Recently Expo light rail service, pedestrian scramble intersections, a bike center, bicycle lanes and bike share have been introduced to Downtown. The next phase will likely see more changes related to car service (Lyft, Uber, taxi), increasing demand for curb space, and technology. Success of the area is tied to the success of the pedestrian environment  continuing to be a place that residents and visitors both want to walk from place to place.  Transportation in Downtown is as diverse as the people who travel there. Downtown is a place that welcomes the service workers who make it function, as much as resident visitors and tourists  who may take a bus, ride the train, drive with friends, or take a tour bus. People come in buses, carpools, on foot and by bike and walk throughout the district. Providing a quality transportation experience requires flexibility to make it more effective for all of these roadway users. This includes measuring our performance in making streets serve people first, and prioritizing modes that are more efficient. A new focus in the DCP is the quickly-evolving technology influence on transportation, including electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles and transit service provided by private organizations. Since the inception of the development of this plan, car services, have gained widespread acceptance. The Citys response must be internal, by shaping choices so that the convenient option also meets community values, and external, by actively participating in the field of changing technology. The plan includes recommendations to work with businesses to provide micro-transit, to use technology to provide on-demand transit service, to focus on community priorities such as equitable access to autonomous vehicles, and to participate in regional transportation technology efforts. A new model for mobility requires changes to policies, new investments, different requirements for property owners, adapting business practices, and partnership with the Santa Monica community. Art and Cultural Offerings Create New Opportunities DowntownThe demand for new and more diverse art, cultural and entertainment activities is increasing Downtown. To establish Downtowns identity as a major cultural center, the City must carefully consider new opportunities for cultural engagement to stretch Downtowns vibrancy. Building from the traditionally retail-centered economic base, events, major artworks, unique creative expressions and live music will infuse the street and public spaces to strengthen Santa Monicas as a cultural destination. Additional entertainment choices Downtown, particularly nighttime venues, will provide residents, employees and visitors with a wider array of destination experiences than in the past, such as live performance spaces for theater and live music. The Arts Commission supports the DCPs approach to Art and Culture. The DCPs land use regulations now permit a larger range of art and cultural uses than historically permitted in the past. The Plan includes an invitation to potential museum operators to work with the City to locate a museum Downtown, and identifies several locations where major works of public art could be located. At its November 21, 2016 meeting the Arts Commission enthusiastically supported the inclusion of arts and culture into the DCP, and offered the several recommendations, which have largely been incorporated into the final Plan:           Encourage policies and public/private partnerships that promote robust artistic activities throughout downtown, in businesses, open spaces and vacant storefronts.          Support Creative Placemaking efforts that enhance other city goals, such as mobility and activating open spaces.          Wherever possible, the DCP should ease restrictions and streamline procedures to facilitate pop-up art interventions in underutilized spaces.          Encourage the development of public and public/private open space, and provide incentives for artists and arts groups to work with City Cultural Affairs staff to develop and implement art and Creative Placemaking programs downtown.          Position Downtown Santa Monica as a cultural destination          Expand options for live music and the performing arts in downtown facilities and businesses.          Of the affordable housing that is produced Downtown, 10% of the units should be designed and set aside for artist housing or live/work units.  The DCP directly addresses all of the recommendations of the Arts Commission through its policy framework and subsequent implementation actions with the exception of the Arts Commissions recent request that artist housing or live/work units be included as part of the DCPs affordable housing requirements. Additional refinements have been recorded in the recommended Addenda that reflect specific direction on certain actions. Community Wellbeing The Citys Wellbeing Project looks beyond traditional performance measures or economic indicators and uses a new method to gain an understanding of how all of these factors interact and affect residents quality of life. The core of the project is the Wellbeing Index, which provides the City with a snapshot of its current wellbeing strengths and needs by analyzing data collected from residents, city departments and social media to gain a robust understanding of how the people of Santa Monica are doing across multiple measures known to influence wellbeing.  The Wellbeing Index demonstrates that Downtown residents benefit from many positive dimensions, such as access to healthy food, proximity to culturally enriching experiences and institutions, use and enjoyment of Downtowns outdoor spaces, and frequent use of the many mobility options provided. However, the Index also points to areas of concern that highlight the growing pains of a residential neighborhood in its infancy. The metrics for stress, stability and life/work balance all register slightly higher Downtown than any other neighborhood in the city. One indicator of particular concern to the planning team reveals that Downtown residents do not feel connected to one another in the way that fosters community, trust among neighbors, and social interaction. Tying the results of the Index to Plan policies and standards strengthens the logic for prioritizing affordable housing, public open space, new neighborhood serving uses, youth and senior services, and many others.  The Social Services Commission submitted their recommendations to the Planning Commission on April 26, 2017. Specifically, the Social Services Commission recommended the use of the Wellbeing Project data to guide development agreement negotiations and be used as a tool to advance a diverse and multigenerational Downtown community, support for affordable housing, and specificity for policies supporting wraparound community and social services to serve the Downtown community. Recommendations that development projects include setasides for affordable/low-cost office space and community rooms could not be included due to lack of nexus between such requirements and new development; however, such amenities could be included in negotiated projects. Many of the Social Services Commissions recommendations were included in the Planning Commissions final recommendation on the DCP.B.   IMPLEMENTING AND MONITORING THE PLAN Implementation of the DCP will be a shared responsibility. Chapter 6 outlines all actions in the Plan along with a relative estimate of cost, responsibility, timing, and potential funding sources (Table 6.1 of the draft Plan). This can used as a budgeting tool and also as a means to support grant applications. Table 6.1 demonstrates that implementation of the DCP will be a shared responsibility dependent on not only City leadership but also coordination with community partnerships and cooperation from private entities.  The DCP monitoring report will be prepared concurrent with the LUCE 5-year Measuring and Monitoring Report. One key area that will be monitored is the development cap of 3.2M square feet of net new floor area in Downtown. This development cap represents the amount of new development that could occur that would still allow achievement of the LUCE goal of No Net New PM Peak Hour Trips. Any project proposal that exceeds the cap would not be able to be approved until additional environmental analysis and amendments have been completed. There are also other indicators to monitor the performance of the DCP listed on Page 247-249 of the draft Plan. A.   COMMUNITY OUTREACHMany years of outreach have marked the development of the DCP. Interdepartmental staff and the planning team have worked with community stakeholders and the Citys Boards and Commissions to tackle challenging issues in search of consensus, and have listened intently to the perspectives brought forward by the many voices involved in shaping the Plan. Beginning in 2012, outreach on the DCP has taken on many forms, from workshops on Emerging Themes, Community Benefits, and Urban form, to stakeholder interviews and meetings with the Planning Commission and City Council. In total, seven workshops were held to drill into Plan concepts and generate feedback from the community. At the onset of 2016, staff re-engaged the community on a variety of topics to move closer towards consensus and to refine the Plan. 2016 Outreach and EngagementBeginning shortly after the Planning Commissions March 2nd, 2016 meeting, staff launched an unprecedented outreach campaign to community groups and local organizations, employing the Citys Office of Communications as a partner in diversifying the input opportunities and in reaching new voices within the community. The outreach tools and platforms used to engage thousands of people were expansive and yielded greater detail about the communitys preference for things like open space, art and culture, mobility, jobs and housing and historic preservation. Importantly, the outreach also demonstrated that there are a great many perspectives on height, development and planning for large sites that have the ability to support much desired amenities.  A detailed breakdown of the 2016 outreach and supporting documentation is provided in the November 16, 2016 Planning Commission staff report. Below is a snapshot of last years outreach by the numbers:          1,200 people provided feedback on Downtown priorities in workshops, focus groups and online         Over 40 community presentations were given to local groups and organizations in both English and Spanish          7 community conversation focus groups were held at the Main Public Library and at Senior Residences Downtown         3 public workshops were held on the subjects of Placemaking, Preservation and Change and Mobility         3 Downtown walking tours were co-hosted by the planning team and the Santa Monica Conservancy         4.6 million social media impressions were recorded on facebook, twitter and instagram         8,700 unique visits to the DCP website, www.downtownsmplan.org Leading up to the release of the 2017 Final Draft Downtown Community Plan, staff held several events to provide a broad overview into the content of the Plan and to establish a rapport with interested community members who sought clarifications on key subjects or who had questions about the collective vision for Downtowns future. B.   ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS In accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a Program Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was prepared that analyzed the potential environmental effects associated with the DCP. The Draft Program EIR was circulated for a 90 day public review period beginning on February 3, 2016 (exceeding the minimum 45-day public review as required by Section 15067 of the CEQA Guidelines). In addition, a Recirculated Draft EIR was circulated for a 45-day public review period in February 2017 to reflect changes that were made to the draft DCP. Comments on the Draft EIR and Recirculated Draft EIR included public concerns about development in Downtown, the Miramar established large site, height, traffic, aesthetics, and neighborhood character. The Final EIR provides written responses to all comments received on the Draft EIR and Recirculated Draft EIR. Some minor text changes and clarification were also included in the Final EIR. The Final EIR analyzes the effect of potential land use changes that could occur in the Downtown through 2030 as a result of the implementation of the DCP, including review of the range of impacts between two different buildout scenarios. Scenario A (High Scenario) would entail higher FARs for sites in the Downtown with variation by district, and represents the City Councils outside parameters for EIR analysis established during the August 13, 2013 meeting, which includes FARs up to 5.0 for the established large sites. Scenario B has a lower range of FARs, with up to 4.0 FAR for the established large sites. Scenario B represents a maximum cap of 3.22 million sf of net new floor area in the Downtown. The Final EIR identifies significant and unavoidable impacts for air quality, construction effects, construction noise, cultural resources, and traffic. Specifically because the details of specific future projects occurring in the Downtown are unknown, the Final EIR concludes that construction-related air emissions and noise (vibration) would be significant and unavoidable. Furthermore, although the DCP would establish greater preservation policies and standards, the Final EIR concludes that historic impacts would be significant and unavoidable since individual projects could involve the demolition or alteration of a historic resource. Additionally, due to the Citys stringent thresholds for traffic and the existing levels of traffic in Downtown, the Final EIR identifies significant and unavoidable impacts with respect to traffic (automobile delay). Aesthetic impacts of the DCP, including those due to building height, are considered less than significant pursuant to Section 21099 of the CEQA Statute, which states that aesthetic impacts of residential, mixed use, and employment center projects in transit priority areas are considered less than significant.  Most importantly, the Final EIR concludes that Scenario B of the DCP (with 3.2 million sf cap) would achieve the goals of No Net New PM Peak Hour Trips by 2030, and would reduce per capita vehicles miles traveled (VMT) and greenhouse gas emissions, which is consistent with the intent of SB743 and upcoming changes to CEQA. Additionally, as noted in the Final EIR, the DCP implements the sustainability and greenhouse gas reduction goals and policies established in the Citys LUCE, Sustainable City Plan, Climate Action Plan, and SCAGs Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy. The DCP is based on a vision of supporting and enhancing the Downtown as a multi-modal district that is fully integrated with the Downtown Station of the Expo LRT. The DCP also emphasizes new land uses in areas proximate to the Downtown Station to minimize vehicle trip generation, vehicle miles traveled, and associated GHG emissions. Additionally, the Plan would enhance multi-modal relationships, calling for new connections and circulation improvements for all modes as well as aggressive TDM measures such as employer trip reduction plans and subsidized transit passes or transportation allowances for residents and employees. Collectively, the standards, policies, and programs in the DCP would support sustainability and GHG reduction goals established by the State, region, and City. As required under CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(a), the Final EIR includes a discussion and evaluation of \"a reasonable range of alternatives to the project, or to the location of the project, which would feasibly obtain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project, and evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives.\" The EIR provides a robust analysis of the DCP as well the following alternatives. The alternatives analysis provides City decision-makers with a reasonable range of alternatives to consider to reduce or avoid impacts.         Alternative 1  No Project Alternative;          Alternative 2  Reduced Project (Elimination of Tier 3) Alternative;          Alternative 3  4th/5th Streets On-Way Streets Circulation Plan;          Alternative 4  Expanded One-way Streets Circulation Plan; and          Alternative 5  Hotel/Tourism-focused Land Use Mix Alternative.  CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6 requires that an EIR identify the Environmentally Superior Alternative to the proposed project from among the alternatives analyzed. If the No Project Alternative is found to be environmentally superior alternative, the EIR also identifies an Environmentally Superior Alternative from among the other alternatives. For a broad policy document such as the DCP, the potential exists that there may not be a clear Environmentally Superior Alternative. An alternative may have some reduced impact levels and other impacts that are greater than the project, while another alternative reduces different impacts. Although CEQA does not provide specific guidance in this matter, where a project has lower impacts in a majority of resource areas and/or substantially lower impacts in especially critical resource areas, this can support a finding that that alternative is environmentally superior.  Alternative 2 (Elimination of Tier 3 Projects) would reduce transportation-related impacts on intersections; however, elimination of Tier 3 developments would substantially reduce community benefits and substantial affordable housing and multi-modal transportation investment opportunities within the Downtown, potentially resulting in increased vehicles miles traveled. Therefore, in comparing an incremental reduction in the severity of significant impacts with the achievement of Project goals and objectives, the EIR determined that the implementation of Scenario B of the DCP would be the environmentally superior alternative. Implementation of Scenario B would incrementally reduce potential environmental impacts relative to Scenario A, but implementation of Scenario B would also still achieve all of the goals and objectives of the DCP. The Final EIR was presented to Planning Commission for review in April 2017, who recommended certification of the Final EIR. Adoption of the DCP would require Council certification of the Final EIR, and adoption of a Statement of Overriding Considerations and the mitigation measures identified in the Final EIR. Mitigation measures are identified in the Final EIR in the areas of Air Quality, Biological Resources, Construction Effects (Air Quality), Cultural Resources, Hazards/Hazardous Materials, Public Services, Utilities, and Transportation and Circulation. To ensure that these measures are properly enacted, a mitigation monitoring program is necessary and will be enforced during the construction and operation of the project.  C.   PLANNING COMMISSION COMMENTS ON THE PLANDuring the months of April and May 2017 the Planning Commission held six public hearings to discuss the DCP (April 25, May 10, May 11, May 17, May 18 and May 31) and its Program Environmental Impact Report. These meetings, which spanned over 40 hours of discussion, also provided the opportunity for the community to comment on the Plans content, and for staff to clarify concepts. The Commission recommended adoption of the DCP with specific amendments and modifications that are listed in Exhibit B to the adopting resolution (Attachment B). The modifications largely pertain to key development standards and Plan policy that encourage the production of housing, as well as the range and location of land uses that are desired for the area. Housing ProductionAmong the productive clarifications to design standards, mobility actions, open space creation and well-being targets, the Planning Commissions most impactful recommendations were to increase several housing-related process thresholds to further stimulate housing production Downtown. Hence, the Commission has recommended that typical mixed-use housing projects up to 60,000 square feet, on lots no greater than 15,000 square feet, be processed ministerially through an Administrative Approval, which would greatly reduce the time necessary to process a development application. In the Transit Adjacent District, the only area in Downtown that has a Tier 3 option, the Commission recommends a Development Review Permit process for housing projects up to 90,000 square feet. This process threshold represents the amount of maximum allowable floor area that could result from a project located on a three-lot site of 22,500 square feet. The Planning Commissions recommendation was based on overall consensus that this area can support greater densities on account of proximity to the Expo Light Rail. Comparison of DCP to Planning Commission recommendations for Housing Project Review ProcessLess than 30,000 SFProject on lots up to 15,000 SF (typically results in projects less than 60,000 SF) All Tier 2 Tier 3 30,000 - 60,000 SFTier 2 on lots over 15,000 SF Tier 3 on lots over 15,000 SF and up to 90,000 SFTier 3 over 60,000 SFTier 3 over 90,000 SF Established Large Site Standards and ProcessLastly, the Commission spent considerable time discussing the DCPs options for the Established Large Sites, three sites within Downtown that - given their parcel size - could potentially provide significant community benefits for circulation, open space and cultural facilities that would otherwise not be anticipated from smaller projects. The inclusion of these sites into the Plan sparked the most extensive and spirited debate among Planning Commissioners. There was consideration of various modifications to the staff recommendation. In the end, without majority support for any particular approach to these sites, the Commission narrowly recommended (4-3 straw vote) the removal of the Established Large Site Overlay, which provides unique height and FAR standards for these sites.  Commissioners who favored including the Established Large Site Overlay sought to establish the DCP as a comprehensive planning tool that creates clear parameters and expectations for projects on the three sites. The Commissioners also supported a transparent and rigorous public review process that requires a development agreement, additional environmental review, and includes special application requirements for the applicant to demonstrate how the project meets the DCPs objectives. The Commission discussed potentially reducing the maximum height to approximately 100 feet with a setback from Ocean Avenue. These Commissioners expressed concern about reviewing Specific Plan amendments for individual projects soon after adoption of the DCP. Commissioners who did not favor including the Established Large Site Overlay supported having the height and FAR standards in Chapter 4, Table 4.2 apply to all Downtown projects. These Commissioners expressed concern that District height limits should not be exceeded and authorizing greater height and FAR in the Plan would signal that increased height is acceptable. There was a desire to ensure that the appropriate form in Downtown is established first through the DCPs base standards and not influenced by community benefits and project amenities. These Commissioners agreed that applicants for each project should submit Specific Plan Amendments for review on a project-by-project basis.  Similarly, the Commission rejected a selection of process options that would have required voter approval or a supermajority of Council to effect changes to the adopted DCP. The Commission was nearly unanimous (6-1 straw vote) in the belief that Council authority is sufficient to render decisions related to Plan amendments, and that the referendum process established in State law provides appropriate opportunities for voters to challenge Councils legislative actions. Access and MobilityThe Planning Commission has actively provided feedback on the Access and Mobility chapter specific actions and overall approach. Following discussion with the Commission, the Plan now calls for preparing for emerging technologies that serves the communitys vision, strengthens the plans consistency with Vision Zero, and updates parking policies that the Commission has since suggested amending. The Commission strongly communicated a desire to not only be forward-thinking but aggressive with implementation, as reflected in the errata sheet recommended by the Commission.  The DCP addresses steps to ensure how technology can best be used to make Downtowns existing transportation network work better for people. The Plan includes an approach to making travel information easier to access through real-time information for transit service, bike share availability, travel times, and parking availability. A methodological use of information on parking and travel patterns can also be used to plan for and manage peak travel periods, which allow for having the right amount of people working at the right times to assist travelers and deployment of the most effective changes needed during peak travel periods. Technology is increasing the viability of shared rides, microtransit or privately owned transit, autonomous vehicles, and widespread acceptance of electric vehicles. The DCP provides direction on how technology can be integrated with transportation in Downtown and how Santa Monica can participate in guiding the development of these technologies in the region.  ParkingClimate change, traffic congestion, and changing usage patterns necessitate shifting parking policies. The Commission has affirmed the right-sizing and right-placing by having a discreet amount of new parking primarily on the periphery of Downtown. There has also been support for studying and then supporting private parking availability for the public.  Parking related changes suggested to Council by the Planning Commission include:         Creating a new parking district in the Zoning Ordinance specifically for the Downtown that supports preservation of buildings through greater flexibility when a use changes. The DCP parking requirements recommend a universal parking rate of 1 space per 500 square feet for all retail and restaurant uses under 5,000 square feet, parking rates are similarly adjusted for residential units. (Zoning Ordinance Amendments)         Enabling the phased development of up to 800 public parking spaces in peripheral locations to address future demand without incentivizing additional vehicle trips downtown (Action AM3.6C)         Pursuing the elimination of 600 public parking spaces within the Bayside Conservation District within 10 years of adoption of the plan. (New AM3.6 Action)         Re-evaluating private parking requirements after 1,500 new parking spaces have been entitled (Action AM3.5G)         Establishing demand-sensitive variable parking pricing, time-limits and marketing. (AM3.6A)         Encouraging use of convenient parking for short-term use through pricing and time restrictions, including installation of meters on 6th and 7th Streets. (new AM3.6B)         Completing the expansion of the Parking In-Lieu Fee program to include all properties in the DCP boundaries by 2019. (Action AM4.5F)         Requiring that new public parking must be built entirely outside of the Bayside Conservation District, including on projects that may overlap with that district, such as the city-owned 4th/5th/Arizona site (new AM3.6 action) The Planning Commission also made a number of recommendations in regards to bicycling, walking and resident access including aggressive implementation timelines. Specific recommendations include:          Creation of protected bike facilities on Ocean Avenue, 2ne Street, and Broadway (Action AM4.3B)         Minimizing the closure of bike and pedestrian facilities due to construction and providing clear and direct alternates when closure is necessary. (Actions AM1.2E and AM1.2F)         Pursuing the creation of a Santa Monica resident transportation pass or credit usable for select mobility services and parking access Downtown, especially during off-peak periods. (Action 4.1K) A.   SPOTLIGHT ISSUES FOR COUNCIL CONSIDERATIONThis section of the report identifies several spotlight issues for Council consideration that were raised in the course of the Planning Commissions deliberations on the DCP. The DCP provides for ample housing production over the life of the Plan through a variety of process and technical incentives that are designed to steer development towards the creation of new residential units. These incentives include a .5 FAR bonus for housing projects over their commercial counterparts, as well as some additional height in the transition zones. Coupled with project requirements for new Affordable Housing, the DCP housing production incentives create the condition to achieve the forecasted minimum of 2,500 new units within the next 15 years. The possibility for additional square footage for housing exists within the volume of development contemplated in the Plans EIR, potentially adding up to roughly 3,100 new units if less commercial, medical or institutional uses are proposed than originally forecasted. Recent criticism of the DCPs housing approach has raised the specter of the nationwide housing crisis with many proponents demanding higher heights and densities than currently proposed or even studied in the EIR. Public testimony and correspondence point to a sentiment that Santa Monica must do more to provide housing to those in need, even though the City is well on track to achieve or surpass its Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) number given by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), and that Downtown has the highest allowable FARs in the entire City. During the Planning Commission hearings, the Commission recommended several process and technical incentive changes that fast-track housing projects Downtown, such as an Administrative Approval process for typical two-lot projects that typically result in projects of approximately 5-6 stories and 60 units. The Commission also recommended a more permissive administrative threshold for 100% Affordable Housing projects and height and FAR increases for 100% Affordable Housing in the Neighborhood Village District. For Council Consideration: Should the Council wish to go beyond the DCPs recommended housing-first strategy, the following options are presented for consideration:Option 1: Increase process thresholds by which more housing projects would qualify for streamlined entitlements.Option 2: Further reduction in height and FAR for commercial projects (e.g. 10 and 0.5 FAR).Option 3: Require all projects on sites of greater than 15,000 square feet to have at least 50% of the floor area be residential uses, except for hotels, movie theaters, auto dealers, public infrastructure, and the Third Street Promenade.Option 4: Increasing the height and FAR standards, subject to additional environmental evaluation  Table of Supporting and Opposing Arguments for Each Policy Alternative1         Provides significant time incentives for developers to seek housing         Creates certainty for community and developer         Perception of reduction in opportunities for public participation2         Would clearly establish preference for housing projects by further reducing height and FAR for commercial projects         Overall reduction in height and FAR for commercial projects was done for neighborhood transitions but implementing this strategy in Downtown core could have unintended consequence of affecting Downtown economic vitality3         Guarantees that any larger project would be required to have 50% residential use, prohibiting strictly office and retail projects (exempting hotels, movie theaters, auto dealers, public infrastructure, and buildings on the Third Street Promenade.         Blanket standard that prescribes land use mix and reduces flexibility in land use decisions          Proscriptive approach instead of providing incentives4         Could result in potentially more than 2,500 new housing units if FAR standards are increased         Would not result in substantially more housing units         Inconsistent with urban design strategy proposed in DCP and widely discussed and endorsed by the community Staff RecommendationStaff recommends further process incentives be considered as described in Option 1, as they would provide clear project requirements with predictable timelines established in DCP. The Planning Commission recommended that an Administrative Approval process would be appropriate for projects on sites no greater than 15,000 square feet. The Commission also recommended that a Development Review Permit would be appropriate for Tier 3 projects no greater than 90,000 square feet in the Transit Adjacent District. This was intended to allow typical housing projects that are similar in size and scale to housing projects that already exist in the Downtown leaving larger projects subject to Planning Commission review.  As a further process incentive, Council could establish a higher threshold for Administrative Approvals (AA) that would provide predictability to applicants with respect to number of housing units authorized, amount of affordable housing units required, affordability level of units, open space requirements, and certainty in applicable development standards. The Administrative Approval (AA) process provides certainty that the project will be approved if it meets all of the DCPs project requirements. This class of housing projects would be required to obtain a recommendation from the ARB before the AA could be approved and would still need to obtain final approval on the project design from the ARB. This process is similar to the procedural incentives that were formerly in place for Downtown in the 1990s that resulted in the production of approximately 2,500 housing units over the course of three decades. The significant difference is the DCP has a variety of development standards in place that are intended to ensure that projects not only complement Downtowns existing character but also contribute to the implementation of Downtown as a vibrant, walkable place that welcomes a diverse population of all income levels. The Planning Commissions narrow recommendation to remove the Established Large Site Overlay from the DCP points to the divergence of opinions surrounding tall buildings in Downtown Santa Monica. Outreach to the community on this subject was balanced at opposite ends, with roughly 50% in favor and another 50% opposed. Those in favor of the Overlay, which would allow three projects to propose building heights up to 130 within an established planning framework, argued that the potential benefits for open space, historic preservation, and mobility outweighed potential negative impacts associated with shade/shadow and scale. Those opposed to the Overlay expressed concern that Santa Monicas identity as a low-scale coastal community would be compromised by tall buildings, and further  that the DCPs standards should reflect a level playing field for all development, and not single out a few exceptions. For Council Consideration: Should the DCP include the Established Large Site Overlay, which would authorize consideration of height up to 130 feet and additional FAR on three sites in Downtown? Staff Recommendation on Height for Established Large SitesThe concept of the Established Large Site Overlay presented in the draft DCP seeks to establish clear expectations in terms of maximum height, appropriate FAR, and open space requirements for three sites in Downtown. The proposal also establishes a rigorous review process that requires a development agreement application and includes additional environmental review and a comprehensive application that demonstrates how the project meets DCP priorities. No Specific Plan Amendment would be required. As legislative actions, development agreements would be subject to the voter approval process already established in State law. Staff believes that there are site-specific reasons why allowing for additional height would lead to superior outcomes for future development on these sites. Staff also believes that imposing a clear maximum height for future projects on those sites provides clarity and coherence to protect the integrity of the overall plan that would be absent if property owners/developers could seek consideration for essentially unlimited heights for projects on those sites  or could seek additional heights on sites where positive trade-offs simply do not apply. Allowing the projects to move forward with the 130 height would allow flexibility for more ground level public space, preservation of historic buildings and features (currently on two of the three sites) and the opportunity for more distinctive and functional architectural massing, modulation and design.  Options for Established Large Site Floor Area Ratio (FAR)Each of the Established Large Sites have individual FAR parameters, which dictate the mass and scale of the projects. While the proposed height of these projects has been the focus of discussions, the projects FARs also have the potential to directly influence the project and community benefits that could be achieved on these three sites. Should Council seek options for exploring revised FARs for these sites, staff proposes three options for consideration:Option 1: Maintain the DCPs existing individual FAR parameters for the Established Large Sites, which were originally presented in the 2014 version of the DCP, and in all subsequent drafts leading up to the final DCP. Were this option to be adopted, it would reflect the original development parameters that have been consistently discussed throughout the multi-year public process of creating the DCP and the proposals that have been submitted to the City by the applicants.Option 2: Modify the DCPs FAR parameters such that all three Established Large Sites would be subject to a universal 3.0 FAR, which represents an average of the development potential across all three sites provided by the DCPs base development standards for each Zoning District. Were this option to be adopted, it would reduce development potential for two of the three sites and ensure that the development of all three Established Large Sites would not exceed the theoretical development potential of the total land area of all three sites were these parcels developed in a series of typical two- or three-lot projects as opposed to the larger block-level projects that have been proposed.Option 3: Modify the DCPs FAR parameters such that the FAR for each of the three sites would be limited to the maximum FAR established for each Zoning District averaged across the whole site. Were this option to be adopted, it would reduce development potential for two of the three sites, which in turn may limit certain aspects of the proposed projects. Comparison between three FAR options for the Established Large Sites1133 Ocean Avenue 191,664 sfFAR=3.0   FAR=3.0FAR: 2.75 (OT)[AVG = 2.75 FAR] 191,664 x 2.75 = 527,076 sf101 Santa Monica Blvd82,500 sfFAR=4.0    FAR=3.0FAR: 3.5 (BC) Split Zone 2.75(OT)[AVG = 3.0 FAR] 31,010 x 3.5 = 108,535 sf51,490 x 2.75 = 141,598 sf4th/5th and Arizona112,000 sfFAR=3.5    FAR=3.0FAR: 3.5 (BC) Split Zone 3.25 (NV)[AVG = 3.4 FAR] 56,000 x 3.5 = 196,000 sf56,000 x 3.25 = 182,000 sf If the Established Large Site Overlay is not included in the DCP, the three sites would be required to comply with the height and FAR standards established in the development standards table. Where there are split zones, the separate development standards for the portion of the property within each applicable zoning district would apply. As a result, applicants would need to submit Specific Plan Amendments for each individual project. Because the DCP takes a housing-first approach, commercial office uses in Downtowns active and transitional areas are limited predominantly to upper floors or at the rear of a project. The one area of the Downtown where commercial offices are permitted at the ground floor is in the Neighborhood Village District, where many existing ground floor offices, such as the Chamber of Commerce, are currently located. At its final hearing on the DCP, the Planning Commission voted to recommend that commercial office in the Neighborhood Village be limited to upper floors or at the rear of a project. Staff is concerned that this recommendation will render many existing offices non-conforming. Additionally, staff is concerned that there is not enough retail demand to justify the elimination of ground floor office (which includes walk-in clientele), and could have the unwelcome effect of producing vacant storefronts.  For Council Consideration: Should the Planning Commissions recommendation to eliminate all ground floor office from the Plan be adopted? If not, the following option is recommended by staff: Staff RecommendationBased on an existing land use survey of the Neighborhood Village District, offices currently make up approximately 45% of the ground floor street frontage. The Planning Commissions recommendation would make all of these ground floor uses non-conforming and replace them with potentially residential or retail uses as change occurs. A 2015 Downtown market outlook report that was used as a point of comparison for the Buildout Analysis demonstrated limits to the amount of retail space that could be feasibly supported in the DCP boundaries. The land use strategy in the DCP establishes the Neighborhood Village District as an area of mixed activity where non-active uses such as residential and office uses could be allowed on the ground floor in mid-block locations only. More active retail and restaurant spaces are strategically targeted for corner locations. The existing retail spaces in these mid-block locations have historically been difficult to lease and the ground floor non-active uses would likely have better compatibility with the residential uses that are anticipated in the district. B.   AMENDMENTS TO RELATED DOCUMENTS Various associated amendments to the Land Use and Circulation Element, Civic Center Specific Plan, and Zoning Ordinance are necessary to implement the goals and policies of the draft DCP. Upon receiving direction from Councils deliberations on the Plan, staff anticipates bringing these associated resolutions and ordinances to Council for formal action on July 25, 2017. LUCE AmendmentThe LUCE is proposed to be amended to reflect the elimination of Tier 3 on Lincoln Boulevard and within the Wilshire Transition district. CCSP AmendmentThe CCSP is proposed to be amended to remove the Colorado Avenue Special Use District. This change is necessary to eliminate overlap and the potential for conflicting regulations between the DCP and CCSP boundaries. Zoning Ordinance AmendmentsThe DCP will be incorporated by reference into the Zoning Ordinance. Where there is a conflict between the Zoning Ordinance and DCP, the DCP shall prevail. Where the DCP is silent, the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance shall apply. There are also a number of zoning ordinance amendments that are associated with the DCP that are being proposed to complement the standards of the draft DCP. These include the following:          Fence, Wall, Hedge height limits  establish fence, wall and hedge standards within the Downtown Community Plan area         Demolition Requirements  requires that demolition application screening and 75-day period are cleared before an application may be accepted for filing         Parking o       Establish parking maximumso       New parking requirementso       Incorporate parking in-lieu fee         Outdoor dining standards  clarify the name of the outdoor dining standards and clarify that the City Manager may promulgate guidelines necessary to implement outdoor dining requirements Associated with the above Zoning Ordinance amendments are anticipated amendments to Division 6 (Land Use and Zoning Related Provisions) and Article 8 (Building Regulations). These include a 100% transportation allowance for nonresidential projects and nonresidential components of mixed-use projects based upon Downtowns higher average vehicle ridership (AVR) target of 2.2 and voter approval procedures for development agreements, if applicable. An amendment to SMMC Section 8.08.060 is proposed to extend the expiration time limits for demolition applications to accommodate the new demolition review procedures. These proposed amendments are attached to this staff report to inform Councils consideration of the DCP. ", "background": "The Downtown Community Plan is a roadmap guiding the evolution of Downtown Santa Monica, a 229-acre area identified by the Citys Land Use and Circulation Element (LUCE) as bounded by Wilshire Boulevard and the I-10 Freeway, and between Lincoln Boulevard and Ocean Avenue. Taking into account that only 4% of the City lies within Downtown (roughly half a square mile), the DCP lays out a framework that integrates housing, jobs, mobility, historic preservation, public open space, infrastructure, and art and culture into a comprehensive long-term Plan. When adopted, the DCP will guide decision-makers and City departments, property owners and developers, as well as local stakeholder groups who provide services and programs to benefit the health and vitality of Downtown Santa Monica and all those who live, work or play here.Creation of the DCPThe path that the DCP has taken to get to this final phase began with the adoption of the LUCE in 2010. The LUCE set forth goals and policies for an expanded Downtown and called for a Specific Plan (the DCP) to propose strategies and standards to create the conditions for a sustainable urban lifestyle. This vision included expanding cultural arts offerings, and adding both intimate and larger open spaces to the growing residential community. The vision addressed traffic, congestion and pedestrian safety by suggesting upgrades to streetscapes, optimizing the circulation network and integrating the Expo Light Rail into the physical fabric of the community in order meet the needs of all people navigating the Downtown. Priority was assigned to public improvements that would enhance the pedestrian experience and to standards and programs that would foster trip reduction by encouraging transit, walking, and biking as well as Transportation Demand Management (TDM) measures. The planning effort has been guided by substantial community participation and the involvement of the Citys Boards and Commissions, including the City Council. Throughout the workshops and discussions, public hearings and events, stakeholders have worked assiduously to shape the DCP into a balanced framework that supports residents, business owners, employees, non-profits, property owners and other community stakeholders. Since initiating the planning process in 2012, several iterations of the DCP have been introduced, including:          September 2013: Downtown Specific Plan Framework. This document included a compilation of the primary components of the Plan including all of the issues that had been discussed to that date. The Framework became the basis of a project description for the Program Environmental Impact Report.         February 2014: Draft Downtown Specific Plan. The first release of a comprehensive Downtown Specific Plan came a year later, adding greater detail to the concepts included in the Framework, and weaving together regulatory proposals with policy. The Draft Downtown Specific Plan underwent a major revision and restructuring process in winter 2016.         February 2016: Draft Downtown Community Plan. The second full-length version of the Plan was released in February 2016 under a new title of Downtown Community Plan. This effort was conducted to recognize the overarching desire to nurture a long-term community within Downtowns boundaries, and to make sure that every Santa Monica resident feels welcome in the Downtown. The revision included an overhaul of the document that resulted in reformatting, reorganization, and text streamlining. The Plan was also made more action-oriented, tying key initiatives to phasing periods and responsible parties both within and outside City government.         April 2017: Final Public Hearing Draft Downtown Community Plan. The final Public Hearing version of the Plan was released on April 12th at a public event at the Civic Centers East Wing. This updated edition comes on the heels of a full year of extended community outreach, and includes several substantial changes from the 2016 text. Over the course of April and May of 2017, the Planning Commission provided comments and recommended changes, which are enumerated in the Addenda (Attachment B). Throughout the various versions of the DCP, the City Council and Boards and Commissions have provided continuous feedback to further refine the Plans core tenets and to provide detail in areas where specificity strengthened standards, policies or actions. The City Council (February 28,2012, July 9, 2013 and October 13, 2015) and Planning Commission (March 16, 2011, January 11, 2012, March 28, 2012, July 11, 2012, December 5, 2012, January 23, 2013, March 6, 2013, July 17, 2013, August 7, 2013, November 2, 2013, November 3, 2015, March 2, 2016, March 3, 2016, November 16, 2016, December 7, 2016, April 25, 2017, May 10, 2017, May 11, 2017, May 17, 2017, May 18, 2017, May 31, 2017 ) have held public hearings and provided significant input into the planning process, shaping the concepts and strategies over the last 5 years. Throughout the planning period, the planning teams communication approach has been fluid to integrate as many perspectives as possible through a variety of means. These include public workshops, focus groups, presentations to neighborhood organizations, online surveys, a dedicated interactive project website www.downtownsmplan.org and a variety of fun events such as walking tours, farmers market exhibitions and community celebrations for major milestones.

Consent Calendar", "body": {"other": "Staff recommends that the City Council appoint the Landmarks Commission Secretary to act as its designee to approve certain minor modifications to the historic lobby based on the recommendation of a qualified historic architect. On August 27, 2013, the Council approved a preservation covenant for the former Downtown Post Office building in advance of its sale to a private party. The preservation covenant, which was attached as a rider to the grant deed, ensures protection of the propertys historic integrity, and that its distinct features and finishes will be retained, including those found in the historic interior lobby space including:   the original hanging light fixtures,  marble wainscot,  horizontal wood walls and ceilings,  metal staircase rails, and  tall tables Please note that further research has since confirmed that the salmon-color marble wainscot is not original to the buildings construction in 1938. The original wainscot consisted of four-inch square terra cotta tiles. A tile believed to be from the original wainscot was found in the janitors closet in the southern portion of the building. The tile was examined by the applicants architectural conservator. It was beige in color, and the material was identified as terra cotta. On March 10, 2014, the Landmarks Commission designated the former Post Office building and the parcel on which it is situated as a Landmark and Landmark Parcel. In doing so, the protection of any historic feature included in the designation would be achieved pursuant to the Landmarks Ordinance, specifically through the issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness. However, as the designation did not include any interior portion or elements of the building, the protection of any of these identified features, as specified in the historic covenant, can only be accomplished through Council approval. A Certificate of Appropriateness is only relevant to those features specifically identified in the Landmark designation. On October 27, 2015, the City Council approved on its consent calendar a procedural and testing protocol for analyzing material samples and finishes on interior portions of the former United States Post Office building. The results of this analysis guided the applicant in developing the plans currently under consideration.  On April 20, 2016, the Planning Commission approved a rear building addition to the former Post Office building and an associated parking variance to accommodate its future adaptive reuse as creative office space. This decision was appealed, and ultimately upheld by the City Council on August 9, 2016. The City Council decision included a condition of approval that encouraged the applicant to present any proposed alterations to the historic interior lobby to the Landmarks Commission for its recommendation prior to formal review of the proposed alterations by the City Council. On September 12, 2016, the Landmarks Commission approved a Certificate of Appropriateness for the proposed building design, colors, materials, lighting and landscaping for the approved expansion and for rehabilitation of the buildings exterior and grounds.  On November 14, 2016, the Landmarks Commission received a courtesy presentation describing the rehabilitation and restoration activities affecting the historic interior lobby that are necessary in support of the buildings adaptive re-use. The Landmarks Commission provided its unanimous recommendation in support of the request and encouraged the applicant to celebrate the nuances of the buildings past as a former US Post Office and reveal this history in the lobby design through retention of past repair work. Commissioners also suggested aligning the wood intersections on the ceiling to minimize the stepping and encouraged the use of light wood finishes. Any new construction should be differentiated through the use of diverse materials. Commissioners raised safety concerns regarding the glass partitions. The historic lobby of the former Post Office building has undergone numerous renovations since the date of its original construction in 1938. The applicant is proposing a two-prong preservation approach in connection with the applicants adaptive reuse of the buildings lobby to accommodate creative office space; rehabilitation and restoration.  Rehabilitation is the act or process of making possible a compatible use for a property through repair, alterations, and additions while preserving those portions or features which convey its historic, cultural, or architectural values. Rehabilitation allows compatible new construction. Generally speaking, the proposed rehabilitation work includes the removal of non-historic features and materials and the installation of any replacement, and the construction of a new partition walls to separate the reception lobby and commissary spaces. Restoration is the process of accurately depicting the features and character of a property as it appeared at a particular period of time, typically its period of significance. This is accomplished by removing features from other periods in its history and reconstructing missing features from its period of significance. The restoration activities proposed will return the configuration, materials, and finishes of the terrazzo flooring and wood board cladding to their original appearance.Specific details of the proposed rehabilitation and restoration of the lobby is presented below, specific to general building parameters. The plans were developed by the applicants preservation architect, and represent the recommended treatment to ensure consistency with the Secretary of the Interiors Standards for the Treatment of Historic Resources, as required by the Preservation Covenant. WallsThe lobby walls and ceilings are partially clad in sugar pine (a type of white pine) which would be retained in place. The walls have experienced discoloration and are showing signs of crazing (cracking) and separation. The proposed treatment of the historic wood cladding would include removal of the layers of coating using a chemical application, cleaning of the wood, and application of a new clear coating. A reddish-brown oil based stain will be applied, matched to the color of the trim. Following the removal of non-historic alterations, any holes would be patched or wood boards would be replaced in-kind, as necessary and where appropriate. The existing non-historic marble wainscot would be removed and replaced with new natural limestone slabs in a neutral grey color with a honed finish. This will result in an appearance that would be more consistent with the appearance of the original tile wainscot.  The historic, individual customer service windows along the west wall would be reestablished with an interpretation that would generally utilize historic sizes and pattern based on original drawings and early photographs. These new windows would be comprised of clear glass with signage panels above and painted surrounds and sills. For fire safety purposes, the sills and surrounds would be reimagined in steel (as opposed to wood) and painted to match other features of the lobby. Gold leaf lettering would be restored on the signage panels above each service window based on original drawings, and individually would read as Parcel Post, Stamps, General Delivery, Information, and Registry.  A non-historic roll-up metal door and counter at the south wall recess would be removed and infilled with a new wood frame and glazed double-door. The janitors original wood door would be fixed in place. The original stainless steel handrail would be reinstalled in the same location on this wall, and the decorative stainless steel railing surrounding the stair in this location will also be retained in place. Ceiling and LightingThe historic wood ceiling would remain in place and would be repaired and treated in the same way as the historic wood walls. The six historic pendant light fixtures would be re-lamped and restored to original sizes (where previously truncated). Any canned lighting will be removed.  Terrazzo FlooringThe existing terrazzo lobby floors will be retained, repaired, cleaned and treated with an application of a new protective clear coating.  PartitioningThe non-historic wood and glass partition wall that separated the customer service area from postal boxes area of the lobby will be removed. A new wood and glass partition wall will be installed in a new location that aligns with the pilasters directly south of the northern entrance. This new partition wall will serve to divide the historic lobby into a reception lobby in the northern end from a commissary dining room in the center. A secondary free standing partition wall would further divide the commissary space in the center from an employee lounge area to the south. The partitions would include mill work for storage. Per the recommendation of the Landmarks Commission, the millwork aspect of these partitions would be clad in maple to differentiate the new additions from the historic sugar pine clad walls. Also, the extensive use of glass maintains the spatial relationships and feeling that the lobby is one long rectilinear space. Desk and TablesThe lobby consisted of five original tall maple tables with stainless steel feet and non-original composite tops. They were originally bolted to the ground. These tables have been identified as historic interior features. The tables would be retained as movable furniture pieces used within the rehabilitated commissary. The tables non-original composite material topping would be replaced with glass, as they were historically.Future Interior Modifications and AlterationsThe approved preservation covenant for the former Downtown Post Office building was approved by City Council in advance of its sale to a private party. The preservation covenant, which was attached as a rider to the grant deed, ensures protection of the propertys historic integrity, and that its distinct features and finishes will be retained, as described in the Background section of this report including those found in the historic interior lobby space. Because the lobby is governed by a preservation covenant that is administered by the City Council, permission to make any alterations, including restoration and rehabilitation activities, must be granted by the City Council. This process could be time consuming to the property owner, particularly when a proposed alteration is minor in nature and will not result in any compromised integrity. To remedy this, staff recommends that the City Council direct any alterations of the historic lobby proposed by the property owner be undertaken with the assistance of a historic architect meeting the Secretary of the Interiors Professional Qualification Standards in Historic Architecture (36 CFR Part 61, Appendix A). Staff further recommends that the City Council appoint the Landmarks Commission Secretary to act as its designee to approve any minor modifications to the historic lobby, such as refinements of approved colors, materials, finishes, lighting, fixtures or partitions, provided that the work will not negatively impact any of the identified character-defining features of the lobby and the work will be completed in compliance with the Secretary of the Interiors Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. The property owners historic architect shall affirm this in written correspondence to the Landmarks Commission Secretary prior to any approvals being granted. Staff further recommends that the City Council retain its review and approval authority on significant changes to the rehabilitation and restoration of the historic lobby, including the removal of any of the identified character-defining features.  ", "summary": " The property owner is requesting approval to restore and rehabilitate the historic lobby of the former United States Post Office located at 1248 5th Street as part of an overall plan to adaptively reuse the Landmark building as a headquarters for Skydance Productions, a film/television production company. The applicant/property owner intends to utilize the historic lobby as both a visitor reception area and a commissary to support on-site employees and guests. Because the lobby is governed by a preservation covenant that is administered by the City Council, permission to make any alterations, including restoration and rehabilitation activities, must be granted by the City Council.  The property owner has retained the services of a preservation architect, Chattel, Incorporated, who has achieved a sensitive design approach that balances corporate prerequisites with historic sensitivity, and provides assurance that the project complies with the Secretary of the Interiors Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. Overall, the scope of work maintains the integrity of the historic lobby and enhances the historic character of the lobby in accordance with the Preservation Covenant and Landmarks Ordinance."}, "title": " Request to Approve Plans to Restore and Rehabilitate the Historic Interior Lobby of the Former United States Post Office Building Located at 1248 5th Street, in Accordance with a Preservation Covenant Administered by the City Council", "Sponsors": null, "recommendations": ["     Approve the request to restore and rehabilitate the historic interior lobby of the former Post Office building, located at 1248 5th Street, a designated City Landmark, as described in plans dated December 19, 2016; and", "     Designate the Landmarks Commission Secretary as its designee to review and approve certain future interior modifications to the historic lobby.", ""], "Department": "Design & Preservation (PCD)"}, {"Category": "03. Consent Calendar", "body": {"other": "The recent heavy rains and saturated soils beneath the intersection at 7th Street have caused the underground wiring conduits to fail and have intermittently thrown the signal into red-flash mode. After evaluation, it was found that much of the conduit has rusted away and is irreparable. Therefore, this is a system network failure that requires extensive work.  The traffic signals at the four intersections have exceeded their beneficial use and are functionally obsolete. Parts are no longer available and cannibalizing aging parts from other intersections provides little guarantee of functionality and puts other intersections at risk of failure. While the signals have been maintained to the safest norms known, the recent wet weather conditions have revealed that many of the underground electric conduits have rusted away, leaving electrical circuits prone to periodic electrical shorting. A piece-meal replacement of hardware would not offer lasting solutions as each existing component is not compatible with modern equipment, and manipulating existing fixtures will increase the failure rate.  The lead time on the site specific replacement materials is about 8 weeks, to be then followed by construction preparation, installation and testing. The entire intersection hardware will be replaced, including poles, signal and pedestrian heads, computer controllers and underground fixtures, that would have been impossible to do in a piece-meal fashion. It is most cost effective to replace the entire traffic signal hardware and computer controllers at once. As traffic signal equipment is specialized and sized to each intersection, larger parts are not kept in inventory but are ordered in advance of anticipated work. The design of the traffic signals is complete and a materials sheet has been prepared to expedite purchase of this equipment.  The recommendation requests emergency authorization to purchase and install traffic signals replacements at the intersections on Montana Avenue with 4th, 7th, 11th, and 14th and upgrade those signals, to the current standard used throughout Santa Monica using the firm, Dynalectric Corporation to perform this work.  Accelerating the funding at this time will help to get the work expedited, to arrange for the safe and efficient conduct of traffic as soon as possible, to obtain a contractor familiar with this type of electrical work now during the less busy construction season, and to aggregate the acquisition of materials for these 4 locations at one time to save money over individual purchases of equipment. Coordination will occur between Planning and Community Development, Public Works, Police, Information Systems, Fire, and Finance Departments to establish an expedited delivery and construction schedule.  Vendor/Consultant SelectionStaff recommends Dynalectric Corporation to furnish, deliver and install traffic signal and associated equipment for four intersections as an exception to the competitive procedure. The product or service is required immediately due to an urgent or emergency situation. The recommended action is permitted under: SMMC 2.24.071 Public works contracts.(e) By two-thirds affirmative vote of its membership, the City Council may forego the bidding procedures otherwise required by this Section if the City Council finds that: (3) Due to urgent necessity, the public health, welfare or safety would be jeopardized if the bidding procedures of this Section were followed. Following the normal bidding process could extend replacement of these intersections by four to six months. Cost and time savings may be achieved from this purchase of traffic signals for four intersections at once, as opposed to the single intersection approach, and Dynalectric Corporation is a firm uniquely qualified to provide this service, due to its consistent good record of service and knowledge of the City, ability to meet expedited timelines in short order, and ability to meet high expectations for traffic control and accommodation of all users, including pedestrians, bicyclist, and motor vehicle and transit access at an acceptable price point. Environmental AnalysisThe project is categorically exempt under CEQA: Section 15303 (Class 3) - New Construction, as it is the replacement of existing city infrastructure, in kind, and not substantially negatively affecting the surrounding environment. Public OutreachExtensive information has been distributed to external partners via social media and targeted SMAlerts, including known residential community organizations such as, NOMA, WilMont residents, and Northeast Neighbors, as well as citywide communication venues such as Know Before You Go (KBUG). Coordination will continue to occur between PCD and Public Works, Police, ISD, Fire, and Finance Departments to establish an expedited delivery and construction. Next StepsUpon approval of the recommended action, staff will work to proceed with the purchase order and seek to expedite the procurement of hardware and seek earliest dates for installation, conducting community and other stakeholder outreach to minimize construction impacts. Upon Council approval and purchase authorization, work will begin immediately to install temporary traffic signals at Montana Avenue at 7th Street to serve interim needs. Although materials will be ordered immediately, work at each intersection will take the better part of 5 months to complete, with inclusion of traffic control and temporary traffic signals. The 7th Street Signal replacement has a target completion of late August 2017 based on known holidays, restrictions of noise-making construction in proximity to residential areas, local events, and best weather options. The remaining three signals will be of similar duration to install although some overlap can be accommodated to expedite the work within 9 months, to late 2017/early 2018. ", "background": "The traffic signals along the Montana Avenue and San Vicente Blvd. corridors are part of cohort of 12 signals installed over 39 years ago, and are the oldest in the Citys inventory for which replacement parts are no longer available. They have been in 24-7 operation since their inception, and the particular signals at 4th, 7th, 11th, and 14th Streets are part of that cohort that represent about 65% of the traffic signal service calls citywide. The four signals pegged for immediate replacement represent about half of that 65% of calls. The traffic signal at 7th and Montana remains in a failed condition and enters into an irreparable red-flash mode after major rain events. Without these replacements, traffic flow along Montana Avenue and 7th Street, a key north-south corridor for the north side of the City, will be severely disrupted.   ", "summary": "Due to an emergency necessity, four traffic signals along the Montana Avenue corridor must be replaced immediately, beginning with the 7th Street at Montana Avenue traffic signal. The existing equipment is no longer commercially available, is functionally obsolete, and piece-meal repairs are unworkable as additional points of failure may arise with further manipulation of that equipment. Permitted under Santa Monica Municipal Code 2.24.2071 (e)(3), this priority request seeks to order new fixtures immediately, to expedite replacement of traffic signals at Montana and 4th, 7th, 11th, and 14th Streets that have begun to fail with increasing frequency. The 4 signals along Montana Avenue needing immediate replacement are among the highest that require constant response to failure, representing about two-thirds of the calls citywide.  Accelerating the funding at this time will help to get the work expedited, to arrange for the return of safer and efficient conduct of traffic as soon as possible, to obtain a contractor familiar with this type of electrical work now during the less busy construction season, and to aggregate the acquisition of materials for these 4 locations at one time to save money over individual purchases of equipment.

Attachment D provides a detailed comparison of the various licenses. Both medical and recreational cannabis business activities will require permitting and licensing by both the relevant state authorities and the local jurisdiction.    TaxesMCRSA did not create any new taxes for cannabis businesses, however the tax scheme created by AUMA will apply to medical cannabis in addition to recreational cannabis. All businesses (for-profit and nonprofit) operating pursuant to MCRSA are required to have a sellers permit with the State Board of Equalization. The following graph provides an outline of the taxes under both MCRSA and AUMA.  Tax Medical Cannabis(Licensed under MCRSA) Recreational Cannabis(Licensed under AUMA)Sales and Use Tax*Effective November 9, 2016Exempt10.5% (Santa Monica)Effective January 1, 2018 15% Excise tax on gross receipts for both medical and recreational cannabis. The excise tax would be imposed on purchasers of cannabis or cannabis products sold in California. Effective January 1, 2018 Tax on all harvested medical and recreational cannabis that enters the commercial market. Tax does not apply to cannabis cultivated for personal use or cultivated by a qualified patient or primary caregiver. Tax is calculated as follows:         Cannabis flowers: $9.25 per dry-weight ounce         Cannabis leaves: $2.75 per dry-weight ounce *AUMA requires that a study be conducted by January 1, 2018, to determine whether nonprofit recreational cannabis businesses should also be exempt from the state taxes and fees. Any cannabis businesses operating within Santa Monica would also be subject to all Business License requirements outlined in Article 6 of the Santa Monica Municipal Code. As such, a for-profit cannabis retailer, whether for medical or commercial uses, would be classified as Tax Rate Group 1 Retail business under Section 6.08.140 of the Santa Monica Municipal Code and would therefore be required to pay $1.25 for each $1,000 or fraction thereof of gross receipts in excess of $60,000 in addition to a $75 minimum tax on receipts up to $60,000. For example, a business that report $1,000,000 in gross receipts for the tax year would be required to pay $1,255 in business license tax.  Local governments can impose additional taxes on cannabis businesses, however, imposing any new taxes would require voter approval.  The State also adopted several other bills to augment MCRSA and AUMA and new legislation has been introduced that is currently pending in the legislature. (Attachment E). For the purpose of this report the term cannabis is used interchangeably with marijuana. It is also intended to mean cannabis in raw plant form (i.e. flower, bud) and processed forms (e.g. edibles, beverages, extracts, topicals, etc.). The laws regarding cannabis are complicated and conflicting. Laws differ dramatically from state to state, between states and the federal government, and between the MCRSA and AUMA within California. Most importantly, cannabis remains illegal under federal law. Recently, federal officials have made statements to indicate that they may view state authorized medical marijuana use differently than recreational marijuana use for enforcement purposes.  As of November 9, 2016, the use of both recreational and medical cannabis has been entirely legalized in Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. The District of Columbia has also fully legalized recreational and medical cannabis, but the sale of cannabis for recreational use is currently blocked by Congress. For the remaining states, laws vary widely with some states only legalizing the non-psychoactive form of cannabis (i.e. CBD). Medical cannabis has been distributed in a retail setting through dispensaries in California since the voters adopted the Compassionate Use Act (i.e. Proposition 215) in 1996. A person must demonstrate that they have a physician recommendation to use cannabis due to a medical condition.  The Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) is currently in the process of establishing the Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation (bmcr.ca.gov) which will regulate various aspects of the cannabis market for both medical and recreational cannabis businesses, including cultivation, transporting, distribution, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, testing, and retail sales. The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) has begun establishing the Medical Cannabis Cultivation Program (MCCP) to develop regulations for cultivation. The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has begun establishing the Office of Manufactured Cannabis Safety (OMCS) but has not produced any publications to date. The following chart provides a high level summary of the administrative structure for establishing the regulatory scheme:          Distributors         Dispensaries         Transporters         Cultivation         Track and Trace         Manufacturing          Testing  State agencies are also currently establishing rules to govern the market which means the state of cannabis regulations for both medical and recreational businesses are far from settled and will likely continue to develop for the next several years.  Enforcement Challenges and ComplianceRegardless of the action taken by Council on recreational cannabis related business activities within Santa Monica, enforcement and regulatory staff will still need to be prepared for the unfolding impacts of legalization statewide. The legalization of cannabis has brought increased challenges and costs for law enforcement. Particularly since Los Angeles borders Santa Monica, cannabis related tourism will also likely grow. In preparation for this study session, staff attended the 2016 Marijuana Management Symposium, a gathering of regulators, law enforcement personnel, elected officials, public health officials, and tourism staff. Denver has seen a decrease in arrests but an increase in demands on police. The most common cannabis industry related crime in Denver is burglary, accounting for 63% of cannabis industry related crime in 2015.  Law enforcement representatives at the symposium emphasize a need to provide adequate and appropriate staffing for administration, inspections, and enforcement. For example, training of law enforcement personnel around issues related to driving while under the influence (THC or THC-Combination w/Alcohol); no reliable THC field-testing for sobriety exists currently as with alcohol. Law enforcement representatives at the symposium also encouraged cities to obtain clear guidance from policy makers on the prioritization of enforcement. The Police Foundation and the Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police issued Colorados Legalization of Marijuana and the Impact on Public Safety: A Practical Guide for Law Enforcement, which is provided as Attachment F. If Council directs staff to move forward with the selection of the two medical dispensaries and due to the legalization of cannabis statewide, it will be critical for the City to establish:          Procedures for monitoring compliance for any Medical Cannabis dispensaries that are approved to operate in Santa Monica;         Training programs for police officers and other enforcement staff;         Enforcement priorities  Additional staffing may be required to ensure that the cannabis program compliance and education programs in Santa Monica are being addressed. Staff will make any necessary proposals for staffing or resources related to regulating the two medical cannabis dispensaries with any future staff report that may be submitted to create a regulatory permit and selection process. The Legalization of Marijuana in Colorado  The Impact (Volume 4), published in September 2016 by the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, Investigative Intelligence Unit is also provided as Attachment G for additional information.  Licensing OptionsThe Zoning Ordinance currently requires that a medical cannabis dispensary obtain a Conditional Use Permit. The following chart outlines several options to regulate and permit cannabis dispensaries.  Conditional Use Permit (CUP) onlyExisting local law currently requires a Medical Cannabis Dispensary to obtain a CUP.  CUP is approved by the Planning Commission. A CUP may be appealed to or by City Council.  A CUP runs with the land, and does not allow for a vetting process to select each successive business operator. It only allows the City to grant or deny the CUP as a land use entitlement to the property based on objective factors. Would only allow for either a first come, first served or lottery selection process.  Conditional Use Permit w/Regulatory Permit  Existing local law currently requires a Medical Cannabis Dispensary to obtain a CUP. CUP is approved by the Planning Commission. A CUP may be appealed to or by City Council. A regulatory permit is approved by City Staff and appealable to a Hearing Examiner. In addition to the CUPs discretionary entitlement process, a regulatory permit would allow the City to vet and approve each successive operator based on objective factors. The City could create a selection process or rely on a first come, first served or lottery system process.  A regulatory permit provides staff with effective means for enforcement of regulatory requirements.  ", "background": "In 1996 California voters passed the California Compassionate Use Act (CUA), which appeared on the ballot as Proposition 215, creating a limited immunity for individuals who used cannabis for medical purposes to use in court if they get arrested and calling on the legislature to regulate distribution. The legislature cannot change this immunity.In 2003 the State adopted Senate Bill 420, also known as the Medical Marijuana Program Act (MMPA), broadened the CUA to certain transportation related and other offences, provided limited immunity for groups of patients who form collectives or cooperatives, and created a voluntary state ID card program to identify qualified patients who register with the program. Of course, despite the limited California State legalization, marijuana remains a Schedule I Controlled Substance under Federal law. This means that private possession, use, or distribution of marijuana remains, and continues to remain, illegal for all purposes, including medical purposes. In 2013 the United States Attorney Generals Office issued what is referred to as the Cole Memo that it will not interfere with state laws that include robustly enforced strict regulations On June 23, 2015, City Council adopted an update to the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance (ZO) which authorized two medical cannabis dispensaries no larger than 2,500 square feet with the issuance of a Conditional Use Permit (CUP). Distancing requirements from certain sensitive uses such as schools and day care facilities were established among other regulations. The two dispensaries were also limited to the following Mixed-Use and Commercial District locations:          Mixed-Use Boulevard District along Wilshire Boulevard between Lincoln Boulevard and Centinela Avenue;         General Commercial District along Santa Monica Boulevard between Lincoln Boulevard and 20th Street; and         Mixed-Use Boulevard Low District along Santa Monica Boulevard between 23rd Street and Centinela Avenue. The ZO defines Medical Marijuana Dispensary as:Any facility, building, structure, or fixed location where one or more qualified patients and/or persons with identification cards and/or primary caregivers cultivate, distribute, sell, dispense, transmit, process, exchange, give away, or otherwise make available marijuana for medical purposes. The terms primary caregiver, qualified patient, and person with an identification card shall be as defined in California Health and Safety Code Section 11362.5 et seq. Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety ActIn October 2015, the California State Legislature passed and the Governor signed the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MCRSA) which was comprised of three bills (Assembly Bills 243 and 266, and Senate Bill 643). This Act created for the first time a comprehensive regulatory framework for medical cannabis, including cultivation, distribution, manufacturing, testing, and sale. The regulation of this full supply chain of activities for cannabis is commonly referred to as seed to sale regulations by the industry. MCRSA is more far reaching than the CUA and MMPA, which merely provided state law immunity to qualified patients and primary caregivers, but did not regulate the cannabis market itself.  MCRSA mandates that state agencies set up extensive rules and systems to regulate and control the cannabis market. MCRSA establishes the Bureau of Medical Cannabis Control (BMCC) under the Department of Consumer Affairs, which is responsible for administering and enforcing MCRSA, including the writing of rules that will govern the medical cannabis marketplace. MCRSA grants licensing authority to the Department of Food and Agriculture and the Department of Public Health. It ends the current collective/cooperative model by sunsetting SB 420 one year after the Bureau of Medical Cannabis Control posts a notice on its website that licenses are being issued. After that date, all medical cannabis collectives will have to be licensed.  The League of California Cities Medical Marijuana  Revisited After New State Laws, which was delivered on May 4, 2016 at the Leagues City Attorney Spring Conference is provided as Attachment A.  Adult Use of Marijuana Act (AUMA) / Proposition 64On November 8, 2016, California voters approved Proposition 64, known as the Adult Use of Marijuana Act, with 57.13% of voters supporting the initiative. Within Los Angeles County 59.54% supported the initiative, and in Santa Monica, the initiative was supported by 71% of voters. The AUMA took effect November 9, 2016, immediately following the election. Under AUMA a person 21 years of age or older may now possess, process, transport, purchase or give away (to persons 21 years of age or older) not more than 28.5 grams of cannabis in the non-concentrated form and not more than 8 grams of cannabis in a concentrated form including cannabis products like edibles and extracts.   Smoking is allowed in a private home or at a business licensed for on-site cannabis consumption, and also allows legal possession of cannabis accessories.  AUMA does not allow for commercial sales without both a state and local permit, and clearly provides that local jurisdictions continue to have full authority to regulate or prohibit any business establishment selling recreational cannabis. Although AUMA authorizes adults in California to legally possess, use, and transport recreational cannabis, there is currently no legal business in the state to purchase recreational cannabis, since licensed medical dispensaries are not allowed to sell recreational cannabis (i.e. to persons who do not have the required physicians recommendation to purchase medical cannabis). Though out-of-state residents can legally purchase recreational cannabis under AUMA, they too may not do so until state and local licensing begins, as currently licensed medical dispensaries may only dispense medical cannabis to California residents for medical use. At this point in time a person may use it, give it, and grow it; but they may not sell it. Under AUMA, a person may not:         Consume cannabis in a business establishment unlicensed for such use;         Smoke cannabis anywhere smoking tobacco is prohibited;         Smoke cannabis within 1,000 feet of a school, day care, or youth center while children are present (except in a private residence);         Possess cannabis on the grounds of a school, day care center, or youth center while children are present;         Possess an open container while driving or riding in a car, boat, or other vehicle; or         Consume cannabis while driving or riding in a vehicle (except where local ordinances allow it). AUMA provides that local jurisdictions may impose additional \"reasonable regulations\" on personal cultivation outdoors.  Under AUMA, however, local jurisdictions may not prohibit indoor personal grows of up to 6 plants in a private residence or inside an \"accessory structure\" on the grounds of a private residence that is \"fully enclosed and secure.\"   AUMAs stated purpose and intent is to take nonmedical cannabis production and sales out of the hands of the illegal market and bring them under a regulatory structure that prevents access by minors and protects public safety, public health, and the environment, and control cultivation, processing, manufacture, distribution, testing and sale of nonmedical cannabis including requiring state agencies to establish a program that is nearly identical to MCRSA.  The League of California Cities issued a memorandum dated September 26, 2016, titled The Control, Regulate, and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act (Attachment B). It is important to note that the document was issued prior to the passage of AUMA by the voters. The League of California Cities also published a document on frequently asked questions regarding AUMA which was issued on November 16, 2016, after the initiative was passed by the voters (Attachment C). Key Licensing Provisions of Cannabis Regulations under AUMA and MCRSABoth MCRSA and AUMA establish six nearly identical license categories. Some of the differences include:           Under MCRSA the retail sales permit is called Dispensary and under AUMA it is called Retailer;          AUMA did not create a separate Transporting permit as MCRSA does, instead this activity is covered under the Distribution license;          MCRSA contains a Specialty Cottage cultivation license to accommodate micro farmers.          AUMA created a category of cannabis businesses called microbusinesses which is not included under MCRSA. A microbusiness is defined as a small operator with cultivation space not exceeding 10,000 square feet. A microbusiness license would allow holders to cultivate cannabis and act as a licensed distributor, Level 1 manufacture (using either nonvolatile solvents or no solvents), and retailer all under one license. Following are the license categories that currently exist:  ", "summary": "In 2015, two medical cannabis dispensaries were authorized by the Zoning Ordinance (ZO). Due to the rapid changes in State law governing cannabis regulations, the City has not accepted applications to operate a medical cannabis dispensary. Staff recommends that Council direct staff to establish a regulatory permit and selection process with objective criteria for the two dispensaries envisioned by the ZO, in addition to the required Conditional Use Permit (CUP).  Due to current Planning and Community Development priorities and the uncertainties around how recreational marijuana legalization will play out, staff also recommends that Council direct staff to draft an ordinance prohibiting commercial cannabis related business activities and to update the Zoning Ordinance to address changes in State law related to cannabis regulations. The Council could revisit this in the future based on experience in other communities. "}, "title": " Study Session on Cannabis Regulations", "Sponsors": null, "recommendations": [" Direct staff to draft an ordinance to create a regulatory permit and selection process for medical cannabis dispensaries;", " Direct staff to draft an ordinance prohibiting commercial cannabis related business activities; and", " Direct staff to draft an ordinance to amend the Santa Monica Municipal Code to address changes in State law related to cannabis regulations.", "", ""], "Department": "Planning and Community Development"}], [], [], [{"Category": "07. Ordinances", "body": {"other": "The Citys Noise Ordinance (Santa Monica Municipal Code Chapter 4.12) currently exempts the following activities to varying degrees:   The only limitation the Noise Ordinance currently places upon free-speech activities conducted on outdoor public property resides in SMMC Section 4.12.025, which generally prohibits noise that would unreasonably disturb the peace, quiet and comfort of persons of normal sensitivity and noise that is so harsh or prolonged or unnatural or unusual in [its] use, time or place as to cause physical discomfort to any persons of normal sensitivity. Such general prohibitions have been adopted in other cities and upheld by the courts. Of course, in addition to local law, state law, such as California Penal Code Section 415, also regulates noise on public (and private) properties. Given Councils direction to enhance First Amendment protections, staff proposes to add an additional exemption by amending the Noise Ordinance (see Attachment B) to exempt any non-commercial activity on outdoor public property that occurs between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., not including the Santa Monica Pier and Third Street Promenade that does not immediately abut any exclusively residential use. The exemption would not apply when the non-commercial free speech creates excessive noise at a nearby permanent residence, hospital, or school. This language is intended to account for the fact that residential property can be constructed in virtually any land use zone within the city and many commercial areas already include mixed uses.  Additionally, regardless of local law, Police officers would still enforce state laws noise regulations, including California Penal Code Section 415s prohibition against disturbing the peace. California Penal Code Section 415 prohibits: 1.     Unlawfully fighting, or challenging another person to fight, in a public space,2.     Disturbing another person by loud and unreasonable noise; if this is done willfully and maliciously, and3.     Using offensive words in a public place, if the words are likely to provoke an immediate violent reaction. In conducting community outreach on the proposed change, Unite Here, whose union organizing tactics and police response to them has generated past controversy, has expressed support for the recommended option. On the other hand, reaction from the Chamber of Commerce and Downtown Santa Monica Inc. was critical of the approach. Members expressed concern about potential unintended consequences. Similar concerns have surfaced from some activist members of neighborhood associations concerned about potential spillover impacts on residential areas adjacent to commercial strips although the recommended option is tailored specifically to allay that concern. Council could make no changes to the existing noise ordinance, since existing law would likely withstand a constitutional challenge and provides enforcement staff with the tools necessary to enforce noise related violations.  ", "background": "At its April 12, 2016 meeting a staff administrative item was presented to Council with background information and a recommendation regarding the Noise Ordinance.

At this meeting, Council directed staff to return with an amendment to the noise ordinance to include language that non-commercial free speech in a commercial zone, not already covered by specific laws such as those controlling the promenade and pier, that does not create excessive noise at a permanent residence or a hospital or a school, and that occurs between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., be presumed to be a legal activity.  Noise violations are currently enforced by both the Citys Police Department and the Code Enforcement Division.

Ordinances", "body": {"other": "Code Enforcement staff periodically receives complaints about properties that have remained vacant for prolonged periods of time. These complaints typically specify nuisances that are occurring on the vacant property, such as overgrown vegetation, trash, debris, or unsecured entryways that invite trespassers. Existing state and local law allows Code Enforcement staff to take enforcement action to remedy these types of nuisance violations. Local law does not, and likely could not, deem a vacant property to be illegal simply because of its vacant status. Unoccupied properties with active construction are also not a violation of local law, even if the construction project leaves buildings in a state of partial construction for an extended period of time, if there are no nuisance, safety, or other code violations present. Although staff does not typically receive complaints from the public regarding buildings merely being vacant, citizens have expressed concern about some construction projects that have been delayed and/or abandoned, leaving buildings vacant and unfinished for many years. Staff has identified additional conditions that are routinely associated with vacant properties but can also be found on properties that are occupied. Where these conditions exist on occupied properties, these properties, due to the lack of regular and routine maintenance, can appear to be vacant and abandoned.  In order to ensure that Code Enforcement staff has the means to address citizen concerns about delayed or abandoned construction projects and address other nuisance conditions, staff recommends that Council adopt the proposed Property Maintenance Ordinance, amending SMMC 8.96 - Abatement of Nuisances to include additional violations. In addition to Council direction, staff has included recommended changes that allow staff to address other nuisance conditions to preserve the visual integrity of the city and to eliminate blight.  Property Maintenance OrdinanceStaff recommends that Council approve the attached Property Maintenance Ordinance (Attachment B), which amends SMMC 8.96 - Abatement of Nuisances. The proposed ordinance would expand the types and scope of nuisance conditions deemed to be a violation, which would include violations for which Code Enforcement staff are currently not authorized to take enforcement action, including:Any building or structure left in a state of incomplete construction, partial demolition, or left damaged by vandalism, fire, earthquake or other similar acts, for a period of 6 consecutive months, excluding such time when work is in progress pursuant to a valid building or other construction permit.The proposed ordinance would make unlawful any building that is left in a state of unfinished construction for a period of 6 consecutive months, unless work is in progress pursuant to a valid building or other construction permit. This new provision would allow staff to compel an owner of a vacant building to resume abandoned/significantly delayed construction activity within a reasonable period of time. To ensure that the proposed Property Maintenance Ordinance encompasses the most common conditions related to property maintenance of unoccupied and occupied buildings, including hazardous or unsafe conditions, and conditions of blight, the proposed ordinance would add the following nuisance violations: Graffiti on the exterior of any building, structure or fence that is visible from the public right-of-way.Any driveway on private property that is damaged in such a way as to be hazardous to persons using said driveway.Any structure that is in a state of substantial deterioration which is visible from the public right-of-way.Any dead, decayed, diseased or hazardous tree on private property that presents a danger to public safety.Overgrown vegetation such that:a) Plant material harbors the presence of rats or vermin;b) Plant material overhangs or grows onto or into any public property, including, but not limited to, any public alley, highway, land, sidewalk, street or other right-of-way, so as to cause an obstruction to any person or vehicle using such public property; orc) Plant material constitutes an attractive nuisance, a fire hazard, or otherwise create a danger to public health or safety.Failure to secure all doorways, windows or other openings into a vacant structure, or provide fencing for the entire parcel containing the vacant structure, when required by the City, to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access.Parking of vehicles, vessels, or similar mobile equipment on the grass, dirt, or other landscaped areas surrounding a residential property.Repair and/or disassembling any vehicle or vessel in a residential zone and on residential property, where such activity is visible from the public right-of-way except: (a) Minor repair and service, performed on motor vehicles owned by and registered to the occupants of the dwelling, performed on a driveway, in a carport, or other legally paved surface on private property; (b) The work does not involve repetitive testing of an engine; (c) No more than one (1) motor vehicle, as viewed from the public right-of-way, is being worked on at any point in time; and(d) The work complies with the Citys Noise Ordinance. To aid in the understanding of these violations, staff proposes adding definitions of abandoned structure, attractive nuisance, graffiti, minor repair and service, and substantial deterioration.  Lastly, the proposed ordinance also provides cleanup of Chapter 8.96 to conform the code to practice, such as eliminating the long abandoned City Nuisance Abatement Board. The Board and related code provisions have been abandoned for quite some time, as its makeup and process were called into question by subsequent judicial decisions relating to constitutional due process. The Council later addressed these questions by creating a staff of City Hearing Officers to review appeals of staff enforcement actions. The proposed ordinance continues this, now longstanding, practice, whereby staff enforcement actions relating to public nuisances would be subject to review by independent City Hearing Officers. There is no immediate financial impact or budget action necessary as a result of the recommended action.", "background": " At its May 10, 2016 meeting (Attachment A), Council directed staff to review the Vacant Property Registries of other cities with the purpose of determining whether or not such a registry would be appropriate for addressing the issue of properties in Santa Monica that remain vacant for unreasonable periods of time. Council asked staff to return with a recommendation that included alternative solutions for regulating vacant properties in Santa Monica. To accomplish this, Code Enforcement staff reviewed Vacant Property Registries and Property Maintenance Ordinances in several California cities. The majority of cities that adopted Vacant Property Registries did so during the housing crisis of 2008-09. Staff found that the majority of those cities no longer enforce the registries and the number of properties on some registries is significantly lower since the recovery of the housing market. Many have instead adopted more comprehensive property maintenance standards that encompass a wide range of issues pertaining to vacant and occupied properties and their associated nuisance violations. Staff also conducted a field assessment of known vacant properties located within Santa Monica city limits, and a review of the complaints received by the Division associated with vacant properties. At the time of the assessment, there were 29 vacant properties in the city known to staff, and staff received 23 complaints related to nuisance conditions on 12 vacant properties over the previous twelve-month period.  Complaints related to vacant properties typically allege a particular nuisance condition, such as overgrown vegetation, litter, debris or trespassing. To address these concerns, Code Enforcement staff has used existing local and state laws to compel compliance with applicable codes. Staff has faced some challenges addressing some common nuisance conditions on vacant and occupied properties where enforcement authority is limited. Additionally, existing law does not allow staff to address complaints about properties that have remained vacant for prolonged periods of time, in some cases many years, due to incomplete construction.  At its November 1, 2016 meeting, Council reviewed and discussed staffs findings and directed staff to return with a proposed Property Maintenance Ordinance, amending SMMC 8.96 - Abatement of Nuisances to include additional requirements, including new regulations on buildings or structures that are in a state of incomplete construction for an unreasonable period of time.  ", "summary": " At its November 1, 2016 meeting, Council directed staff to return with an ordinance to amend SMMC Chapter 8.96 of the Santa Monica Municipal Code (SMMC), Abatement of Nuisances to include additional requirements related to vacant buildings, including but not limited to buildings left vacant and buildings left in a state of partial construction for an unreasonable period of time.  In the proposed ordinance, staff has also included additional updates to the code to address buildings left in a state of partial construction, and certain other conditions that are related to the maintenance of both unoccupied and occupied properties to provide Code Enforcement staff with a mechanism to enforce other hazardous or unsafe conditions and conditions that routinely contribute to blight in the community.

Staff received the facilitys annual compliance report on November 4, 2016. All of the site community benefits such as the pedestrian path linking Bergamot Station to Stewart Street, the Sculpture Garden, Pedestrian Caf (LIME), public open space, and widened sidewalk were complete with the construction of the project site.  Operational community benefits such as a local hiring program (currently 8% of its workforce is a Santa Monica resident); internship program for Santa Monica College students or Santa Monica residents; Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District student tours; and providing shared parking for special events at Bergamot Station are on-going benefits. In particular, Agensys has continued its efforts with student tours, lectures, and programs with Santa Monica High School and hosts an annual Family Science Day for elementary, middle school, and high school students in Santa Monica. Agensys is also preparing for their third sculpture exhibit; works of art are being fabricated and installation is anticipated in March/April 2017. This new exhibit was reviewed by the Santa Monica Arts Commission and its Public Art Committee in a special joint meeting in September 2016. The exhibit will feature works by Lynn Aldrich, Jeremy Kidd, Bertil Peterssen & Pontus Willfors.  Financial payments of $70,350 for the projects required Bergamot Station Transit Infrastructure Contribution and $20,000 for bicycle access improvements in the area were verified in January 2014. Agensys is in good faith compliance with these Agreement requirements outlined above.  The Agensys Development Agreement specifies that Agensys initial employee average vehicle ridership requirement shall be 1.6 until such time that the Expo light rail is operational. More specifically, Agensys is required to achieve a 1.6 AVR rate for the a.m. and p.m. peak-hour periods (6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m., respectively). This is due to the project sites location within a higher goal LUCE District for achieving vehicle trip reduction.  The Agensys Agreement also provides that in the event the applicable AVR requirement is not reached in any annual Employee Trip Reduction Plan (ETRP), Agensys shall propose modifications to the TDM program to achieve the AVR requirements by the next ETRP submittal. This issue of non-compliance with the AVR requirement was also reported on during the last two compliance review cycles for 2014 and 2015. As outlined in last years report to Council, the City disagreed with the methodology used for Agensys 2015 AVR survey and the validity of the survey results as reported in its annual Employee Trip Reduction Plan (required for large employers per SMMC Chapter 9.53) because the AVR calculation reported by Agensys was based upon a survey that was taken during a period when Agensys provided transportation incentives that were not offered to its employees during times outside the survey period. This disagreement was addressed in accordance with the procedures established for employer monitoring, enforcement, and administrative appeals under the Transportation Demand Management Ordinance.  Agensys resurveyed its employees in the February 2016 and resubmitted its Employee Trip Reduction Plan to the City in March 2016 demonstrating that the facility achieved a 1.54 AM AVR and a 1.48 PM AVR. While the City approved the Agensys survey methodology and revised Employee Trip Reduction Plan in April 2016, the facility did not achieve compliance with its Development Agreement requirements of 1.6 AVR for the AM and PM peak periods. As a result, City staff followed up with Agensys to clarify what additional trip reduction measures would be implemented to achieve the AVR requirement by the next reporting cycle.  City staff met with Agensys on June 2, 2016 and followed up with correspondence and telephone communications over the summer to determine whether the following four additional trip reduction measures were being implemented in accordance with staffs previous requests:  1.     Provide a daily transportation allowance for all employees who do not drive alone to work that is at least equal to the current monthly transportation allowance ($140) divided by 20, or $7 per day.  2.     Provide a car share or fleet vehicle on-site that may be utilized by all employees who bike, walk, carpool, vanpool, take transit, or otherwise commute to the worksite in a non-SOV vehicle for business and/or personal trips during the workday. This requirement could be met by providing car share subsidies to those employees for an onsite car share vehicle. 3.     Provide employee bike share memberships or a minimum of four on-site Bike@Work bicycles for employees to utilize during the workday for business and/or personal trips during the workday. 4.     Increased marketing of new TDM Plan Enhancements. As of September 2016, staff was unsuccessful in obtaining confirmation from Agensys regarding implementation of these plan enhancements requested by the City or other substitute measures.  In October 2016, City staff was informed that a new team at Agensys would be taking the lead on TDM Program implementation and related obligations as a large employer pursuant to the Citys Transportation Demand Management Ordinance (SMMC Chapter 9.53). After several communications regarding timely submittal of Agensys annual commute survey, data from Agensys survey demonstrated a positive increase since the last survey in February: 1.57 AM AVR and 1.58 PM AVR.  As follow up, City staff met with Agensys new Human Resources Director, new Vice President of Technical Operations, and Director of Engineering and Facilities Operations in December 2016. The parties discussed implementation of the additional TDM measures required to achieve the facilitys AVR requirements, Development Agreement terms, and the difficulties the City has encountered regarding this issue over the past two years. The new team at Agensys committed to renewing their efforts to implement a robust TDM Program, and asked questions about the four additional measures designed to build on the progress made in the last reporting cycle to help achieve the 1.6 peak hour AVR requirements.  ", "background": "Chapter 9.60 of the Municipal Code establishes the processes and requirements for the City to enter into a Development Agreement.

This includes such tasks as evaluating the Citys property insurance program and recommending alternatives to address changing coverage needs; developing and marketing the program to insurers capable of meeting the Citys needs; and securing cost-effective coverage on behalf of the City. The City issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for property insurance brokerage services on October 17, 2016.  The RFP was posted on the Citys on-line bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provisions.

The City has maintained this long standing broker relationship with Alliant because it offers access to the Alliant Property Insurance Program (APIP) - formerly known as the Public Entity Property Insurance Program or PEPIP. APIP was developed specifically to meet the unique needs of public entities, and as the largest property placement in the world, its market share and strength has helped to ensure the City obtains the best property insurance coverage at the most competitive price. The City has participated in APIP since its inception and can only continue to do so as a client of Alliant.  The Citys current property insurance broker agreement with Alliant is set to expire on June 30, 2017 (see June 26, 2012 staff report).  The City continues to survey the marketplace for broker services every five years to determine what other property insurance options are available, and whether these options can compete with APIPs offerings. ", "summary": "The City has an ongoing need for professional property insurance brokerage services to underwrite, market, and secure its property insurance coverage.  This type of insurance protects the Citys buildings and vehicles, valued at over $890 million, from the perils of fire, flood and/or earthquake.  The Citys current property insurance broker agreement is set to expire at the end of this fiscal year, and in preparation for this, staff solicited proposals in accordance with procurement policies and received responses from three brokerage firms.

Consent Calendar", "body": {"other": "The Edison Safe Routes to School Project is funded by a State Safe Routes to School grant that was competitively awarded by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). The City received notice to proceed from Caltrans in August 2013 which allowed the City to begin advertising and selection for design services, and was initiated after substantial completion of the Edison campus reconstruction. Council approved a design contract with Alta Planning and Design on April 12, 2016 (Attachment A), and Council approved a contract amendment to explore a traffic circle on November 22, 2016 (Attachment B). Safe Routes to School is an international movement that aims to increase the number of children who walk or bicycle to school by removing the barriers that currently prevent them from doing so. Those barriers include lack of infrastructure, safety concerns, the absence of basic education programs, and encouragement efforts aimed at children, parents, and the community. Residents, school personnel and parents have raised concerns regarding speeding vehicular traffic, visibility of pedestrian and vehicles, and street crossing difficulties in the vicinity of the Edison Language Academy and the Pico Neighborhood. The City responded proactively in 2014 with the creation of the Michigan Avenue Neighborhood Greenway plan (MANGo, Attachment C). The plan strives to create an inviting neighborhood gathering and sustainable circulation space along Michigan Avenue and along adjoining street extensions like Virginia Avenue. The greenway creates a complete east-west connection on neighborhood streets for people walking and biking to school, City parks and local businesses. The greenway is achieved through elements including roadway calming for pedestrian safety, increased landscaping, bike facilities, lighting, and enhanced crosswalks. The plan was adopted by City Council on February 11, 2014. The plan specifically identified improvements at three intersections: Delaware/22nd Street, 27th Street/Kansas Avenue, and Stewart Street/Kansas Avenue. The Citys Bike Action Plan (Attachment D) was another proactive approach to address some resident circulation concerns, this time for the creation of a bike network. The plan was adopted in November 2011; it identified Pico Boulevard/30th Street/Dorchester Avenue as the location for a median refuge island/diverter crossing enhancement due to challenges of crossing Pico Boulevard, and the importance of providing a comfortable, direct I-10 Freeway crossing via the Dorchester Tunnel. The Edison Language Academy (ELA) is a dual immersion elementary school which recently completed reconstruction of its buildings and campus. The new design relocated the main pedestrian entrance from Kansas Avenue to Virginia Avenue. Morning and afternoon passenger loading occurs primarily at the main entrance where an onsite loading zone was created during redevelopment. The new rear entrance on Kansas Avenue moved slightly west, and the existing crosswalk on Kansas Avenue remains in a location that does not align with the new entrance. The rear entrance still serves a significant number of pedestrians that originate from south of the campus.  ELA is a language magnet school. In order to accomplish a student body balance with English and Spanish speakers, children are accepted from any Santa Monica school or from outside of the City if needed. The school has estimated that about 25 percent of the existing student body is from within the immediate neighborhood service area. Still, many walk and bike to school. In fact, during the October 2016 Bike It Walk It encouragement day, 70 percent of the Edison student population participated. About 47 percent of those participating were walkers. Students who attend ELA from the Grant Elementary School area are within walking and biking distance to ELA. Project Design RefinementThe City received notice to proceed on a competitive grant in 2013 from Caltrans to improve walking and biking to ELA, and by implementing improvements identified in the MANGo plan and Bike Action Plan. The grant included conceptual designs for key intersections, to be refined and constructed through the project development process. The project design refinement process began by investigating improvements at five project locations: 1) Delaware Avenue/22nd Street; 2) Kansas Avenue Mid-block adjacent to ELA; 3) Kansas Avenue/27th Street; 4) Stewart Street/Kansas Avenue; and 5) Pico Boulevard/30th Street/Dorchester Avenue (Attachment E). The following three design elements were considered at these locations: Curb Extensions (i.e. bulb-outs): Bulb-outs are areas where the curb is extended into the roadway at crossings. Bulb-outs improve the pedestrian experience by shortening crossing distances, increasing pedestrian visibility, slowing turning vehicles, and visibly narrowing the roadway to discourage high-speed traffic.  Traffic Circle: A neighborhood traffic circle is a round central island around which vehicular and bicycle traffic circulates. Traffic circles reduce intersection conflicts and excessive vehicle speeds. Traffic circles can help to shorten the sight lines for drivers, focusing their vision on the current block on which they are traveling, increasing awareness of others on the road like pedestrians.  Median Refuge/Diverter: A median refuge/diverter is an island built in a street intersection which allows for two-stage crossing of a busy street by cyclists and pedestrians. It permits those crossing the street to negotiate one direction of traffic at a time, thereby making it easier to cross. Public OutreachOver the past seven months, the City has engaged many residents, businesses, parents and school personnel in a discussion about the proposed changes. The majority of the resident participants live in the Pico Neighborhood. The project outreach built upon the outreach, events, and public workshops that generated the MANGo and Bike Action Plans. In June 2016, outreach began with the Edison Language Academy faculty, Parent Teacher Association and Santa Monica Malibu Unified School District (SMMUSD) Facilities Department. The meetings introduced the project, outlined the outreach process, and provided an opportunity for input. The school and SMMUSD personnel have been supportive of the project and the Citys overall efforts to improving school access. Once concept plans were complete, staff presented the design concepts to the following organizations between October 2016 and February 2017: Pico Neighborhood Association Virginia Avenue Park Advisory Board Virginia Avenue Park Advisory Board Parent Connection Group & Familias Latinas Unidas  Pico Improvement Organization- Friends of Sunset Park Edison Parent Teacher Association Edison faculty and SMMUSD staff Two Community Open House events were hosted by City staff to reduce barriers to participation for neighbors, and Spanish translation was offered: November 15, 2016 Open House at Virginia Avenue Park January 9, 2017 Open House at High Place, Community Corporation of Santa Monica on Virginia Avenue Outreach was also done at community gatherings like the 2016 Fall Festival at Virginia Avenue Park (VAP) to solicit input on the refined designs. Contact cards were distributed during the Posada at VAP. Posters noticing the public about the changes were posted at each of the locations in English and Spanish, with contact information to get project details and provide input. Staff also met internally with City departments to discuss the proposed plans and their potential impacts to City operations like trash collection and emergency services. Based on the existing conditions and feedback from the public and City Departments, staff revised the designs. Many elements of the plan received clear and consistent popular support, while comments were more divided about others. The curb extensions and crosswalks located at Kansas Avenue mid-block and at 27th Street were popular and widely supported. The traffic circle proposed at 22nd Street and Delaware Avenue, the median diverter at Pico Boulevard and 30th Street, and the curb extensions at Kansas Avenue and Stewart Street presented design challenges that required further assessment and in some cases revision to the plan. Detailed comments specific to location may be found below in the Project Location, Assessment and Final Design section. Staff followed up on concerns with field observations, data collection and evaluation, and vehicle turn tests. A traffic impact study was completed to assess the circulation changes that could result from the Pico Boulevard/30th Street/Dorchester Avenue median refuge island. Turning path tests were completed using computer aided design software and followed up with a field test using a physical mark out of the changes in the street and test driving by Public Works and Fire Department staff. Project Location, Assessment, Final Design1) Delaware Avenue/22nd Street.This four-way intersection is directly on the MANGo route, and proposed to receive curb extensions at all four corners, with dual curb ramps, landscaping, irrigation and painted crosswalks. This intersection is one block from Virginia Avenue Park and one block from the busy I-10/Cloverfield interchange.  A traffic circle was proposed in the MANGo Plan at this location. After a land survey and turning test were complete, it was determined that there was insufficient space to accommodate a traffic circle. A number of design options were considered in an attempt to accommodate the planned traffic circle. However, it was found during the turn path field test that a trash truck would not be able to make a legal left turn around the smallest circle considered. Additionally, the location of an underground utility cover in the center of the intersection precluded planting a tree in the circle. This limited the options for adding a vertical feature that would shorten the sightline for drivers. A traffic circle at this location was also less popular with residents. The addition of curb extensions will afford the ability to add landscaping to this location and provide a visual narrowing of the roadway which will make it easier for pedestrians to cross the street and for drivers to maintain safer speeds, especially when turning. Curb extensions were navigable by all vehicles. 2) Kansas Avenue Mid-blockThis mid-block location is on a narrow, undivided stretch of Kansas Avenue and is proposed to receive two curb extensions, ramps and a six-inch raised painted crosswalk aligned with the rear school entrance. Kansas Avenue has on-street parking on both sides, and serves as the back of house for some commercial developments along Pico Boulevard. Most of the surrounding development is multifamily residential. The proposed curb extensions and crosswalk on Kansas Avenue are in response to the school campus pedestrian access changes and not a prior adopted plan. The proposed crosswalk will better align with the schools new rear entrance gate which was relocated during the schools reconstruction. The school entrance is adjacent to an existing speed hump. Rather than remove the speed hump, the new six-inch raised crosswalk is proposed to integrate the new speed hump. Pedestrians would cross on a flat level surface at the same grade as the raised public sidewalk. This speed table crosswalk is similar in concept to the crosswalk constructed in front of City Hall across Main Street. Vehicular passenger loading is also proposed to be consolidated into a 78-foot loading zone on the north side of Kansas Avenue, east of the proposed crosswalk. No net parking will be eliminated to create this crosswalk, because the consolidation of loading zones creates spaces which compensate for any removal for the crosswalk. This project was not funded by the Caltrans grant given the timing of the schools redevelopment but can be added to the project scope and locally funded by the Transportation Impact Fee. 3) Kansas Avenue/27th StreetAt this T-intersection located east of Virginia Avenue, two curb extensions, associated curb ramps, two painted crosswalks, and regrading to remove runnel channels are proposed.A traffic circle was initially proposed by MANGo at this location. After a land survey was complete, it was found that there was insufficient space (less than 20 feet between proposed curbs) to accommodate a traffic circle due to the narrow width of Kansas Avenue. It was determined that pedestrian crossing could be improved by providing curb extensions instead. An additional crosswalk across Kansas is supported by SMMUSD staff and is proposed to allow a crossing alternative to the Stewart Street/Kansas Avenue intersection. This new crosswalk will require the elimination of one on street parking space in order to add red curbing for visibility. Re-grading this intersection will also allow the removal of the concrete runnel drainage channels that cross 27th Street where it intersects with Kansas Avenue. This will remove a cycling hazard from along the MANGo route. 4) Stewart Street/Kansas AvenueThis four-way stop controlled intersection would receive curb extensions and dual curb ramps on three corners of the intersection (except the southwest corner), landscaping and irrigation, painted crosswalks, and painted yellow centerlines. The southwest corner will receive a painted curb and concrete neck down in an effort to avoid impacting the County of Los Angeles storm drain. This location is directly on the MANGo route. The MANGo plan identified curb extensions and enhanced crosswalks at Stewart Street and Kansas Avenue. This location is heavily traveled by school children and parents in the morning and afternoon and is a busy location for automobiles traveling to and from schools and homes in the area, and north-south traffic. A crossing guard is located at this intersection during the morning and afternoon school commute.  The Citys Department of Public Works was concerned that the proposed curb extensions would prohibit a trash truck from turning right onto Kansas Avenue from Stewart Street southbound. This is a travel route for the Resource, Recovery and Recycling (RRR) divisions collection services. Computer generated turning tests demonstrated that the Citys trash truck and Hazmat fire apparatus, which has a more limited turning radius, would be able to make the turn. A follow up field test was undertaken which confirmed early results. The exercise provided some insight into some design changes that would improve vehicle circulation such as increasing the radius of the northwestern curb extension to 20 feet, painting yellow centerlines on each leg of the intersection and adjusting the location of where vehicles are designated to stop on Kansas Avenue. The most significant constraint at this location is the narrow width of Kansas Avenue which requires vehicles to follow the trash truck as it serves Kansas Avenue, an existing condition. It was also suggested that narrowing each Stewart Street approach could increase congestion by eliminating the ability to use the wide travel lane (and adjacent bike path of travel) as two lanes, one for through vehicles and one for right turning vehicles. This narrowing will re-enforce the intended one-vehicle per approach operation and prohibit right turns from occurring simultaneously with through traffic. While this may require some to wait longer to make a right turn, it will provide considerable safety benefits to active transportation users by reducing right-of-way confusion, reducing conflicts with pedestrians, and prohibiting vehicles from blocking the existing northbound bike lane.  5) Pico Boulevard/30th Street/Dorchester AvenueThe Bike Action Plan (BAP) proposed a median refuge island/diverter on Pico Boulevard/30th Street as a crossing enhancement. This alteration would involve completion of the median at the 30th Street intersection and providing two narrow channels (breaks in the median) for cyclists to cross with a separated resting place in the center of Pico Boulevard. The refuge median would include rolled curbing which allows passage of emergency vehicles but would prohibit passenger vehicles from crossing Pico and making left turns from and to Pico Boulevard. The BAP identified the Pico Boulevard/30th Street/Dorchester Avenue location as a key location for improving north-south bicycle access because it links to parts of the bike network that provide lower-stress routes. This location would be one of two marked crossing points between 28th Street and 33rd Street, the other being a crosswalk with Rapid Rectangular Flashing Beacons and signage located at 31st Street. This crossing would make connections to the Dorchester Tunnel and destinations towards the north like Ishihara Park and Expo light rail and bike path. The intersection is home to two bus stops, one on the southwest corner and another on the northeast corner of the intersection. Median Diverters are a common neighborhood treatment in locations where lower volume streets cross higher volume streets. They are intended to make it easier to cross major boulevards by allowing two-stage bike and pedestrian crossing and discouraging through traffic from using neighborhood streets. The design process looked at multiple options, including some which preserved passenger vehicle turns. However, none of these options improved the protection or safety of people crossing, which is the primary goal of this improvement. At the second Community Open House, a number of residents and businesses expressed concern about the implications of restricting left turns from Pico Boulevard/30th Street/Dorchester Avenue, and restricting vehicle through traffic across Pico Boulevard. The concerns included reducing access options to residents and businesses, and how the turning restrictions would alter traffic patterns. A traffic analysis was completed to understand vehicle displacement if the median were completed. The traffic analysis forecasts that vehicle displacement would be relatively small given the number of vehicles that are currently making these turns. For example, 29th Street between Pico Boulevard and Pearl Street, where the greatest increase is possible, could see an increase from 1,633 to 1,804 vehicles over a 24-hour period, and Urban Avenue between Pico Boulevard and Pico Place, could see an increase of 165 vehicles over the course of a 24-hour period (171 vehicles). If the assumption is made that the additional traffic is distributed between 7AM and 7PM each day that is approximately 14 additional vehicles per hour. Typically, a change of this size is small enough to be imperceptible to people living on a street like 29th Street. Similar traffic increases are also possible at Yorkshire Avenue and 31st Street. The study made the assumption that traffic would be distributed to the nearest adjacent street, knowing that some will elect to use 28th Street to utilize the existing traffic signal at Pico Boulevard. While this project has the potential to adjust the way people drive to and from the neighborhood, the safety improvements at 30th Street and Pico Boulevard would provide significant benefits to neighborhood walking, biking and mobility. It is apparent that the outreach efforts have successfully reached a segment of the community that may be impacted by the change and more time is needed for the City to communicate with those residents and businesses. Staff is proposing to delay this project location to allow for additional outreach and evaluation of options which will require these improvements proceed on a separate, decelerated track. Staff would return to Council at the time of construction bid approval for the other changes for final approval of an approach to improving crossing at this location. The Caltrans grant funds included crossing improvements at this intersection. CEQA DeterminationSection 15301 of CEQA Guidelines provides Class 1 exemption for the operation, repair, maintenance, permitting, or minor alteration of existing public or private structures, facilities, mechanical equipment or topographical features, involving negligible or no expansion of use beyond that existing at the time of the lead agency's determination. Projects that fall into this class (Class 1) include alterations to existing streets, sidewalks, gutter, bicycle facilities, and other similar facilities and additions of safety or health protection during for use in conjunction with existing facilities. The project consists of the construction of curb cuts and extensions, ramps/diverters, crosswalk striping, pavement striping, and wayfinding markings on existing streets, sidewalks, and intersections near Edison Language Academy and Pico Neighborhood. No changes to operation (including expansion of roadway capacity) are proposed. Therefore, this project is a Class 1 project that is categorically exempt per Section 15301 of the CEQA Guidelines. Furthermore, none of the exceptions specified in Section 15300.2 of CEQA Guidelines would apply that would preclude the use of these CEQA exemptions - The project site is not located in a sensitive environment, the project will not have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances, the project would not damage scenic resources, the project would not be located on a hazardous waste site; and the project would not cause a change to a historical resource. The next step is to complete the construction drawings for Delaware Avenue/22nd Street, Kansas Avenue Mid-block near school, 27th Street/Kansas Avenue, and Stewart Street/Kansas Avenue. Additional outreach to residents and businesses potentially impacted by the changes proposed at Pico Boulevard/30th Street/Dorchester Avenue will be completed. This will be followed by construction bidding and consultant selection. Staff will return to Council with recommendations on the construction contract and the final Pico Boulevard/30th Street/Dorchester Avenue design. ", "summary": " This pedestrian and bicycle improvement project is funded by a State Safe Routes to School (SRTS) grant from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) for design and construction. The City has been developing a comprehensive SRTS program to improve safe walking and biking to City schools. This project specifically addresses SRTS physical improvements to street crossings in the vicinity of the Edison Language Academy, along the MANGo corridor and in the Pico Neighborhood. Staff requests that Council receive and file the attached designs for the Edison Safe Route to School project. The project improvements were identified in the Bike Action Plan, Michigan Avenue Neighborhood Greenway Plan, and catalyzed by recent changes made during the Edison Language Academy reconstruction. After extensive public outreach, staff has completed refined designs for pedestrian and bicycle improvements at four locations: Delaware Avenue and 22nd Street, Kansas Avenue Mid-block near the Edison Language Academy, 27th Street and Kansas Avenue, and Stewart Street and Kansas Avenue. These improvements encourage safe walking and biking by shortening crossing distances and improving the visibility of pedestrians and cyclists. At three of the intersections, curb extensions and marked crossings will be installed, and at the Kansas Avenue mid-block location a raised crosswalk is identified. A fifth project location at Pico Boulevard and 30th Street/Dorchester Avenue has been withheld pending additional public outreach. This location near the Dorchester tunnel will receive additional design options for a two-stage crossing for people on bikes and walking. An updated and refined design for this intersection is anticipated to be ready for Council review at the time of construction contract approval. The next steps in the process are to complete construction plans for each intersection, and initiate the bid process to select a construction contractor.

", "background": "The Main Street Business Improvement Association (MSBIA) has held the Summer SOULstice festival (SOULstice), an annual, free, one-day, live-music-based event, since 2001. The event features bands on stages located on several closed streets along Main Streets commercial district, as well as an accompanying sidewalk sale by Main Street merchants, and, in some years, an entertainment area for children. The summer event began as a way to celebrate Main Streets businesses, attract residents and visitors to the area, and provide entertainment to visitors of the Sunday Main Street Farmers Market. The one-day event brings vitality to the street, offers the community an opportunity to enjoy a diversity of live bands in an outdoor setting, and provides an economic boost to the retailers and restaurants on Main Street. The Main Street commercial district begins at Pico Boulevard to the north and extends to the southern city boundary, just south of Marine Street. For many years, the MSBIAs Executive Director and the organizations board members have solely produced and financed the one-day Summer SOULstice event.  As production costs and administrative responsibilities have risen over time, MSBIA has sought board members to help with the administrative duties and sponsors to help offset the expenses. Beginning in FY 2011-12 and annually thereafter, Council has allocated discretionary funds to support events organized by the business improvement districts (BIDs) that include MSBIA, as well as the Pico Boulevard Business Improvement District and the Montana Avenue Business Improvement District. The Downtown Santa Monica Inc. BID does not participate in the discretionary funding allocation since they are also organized as a property-based assessment district. MSBIA has used the discretionary funds to cover the Citys fees related to the production of the SOULstice event. The amount of Council discretionary funds allocated to MSBIA has varied each year. The City provided $2,500 in FY 2011-2012, $3,750 in FY 2012-13, and $7,000 in FY 2013-14. In FY 2014-15, the amount of discretionary funding was reduced to $4,000 because the City was able to reduce Police and Fire staffing costs associated with the event. In FY 2015-16, the City provided $7,000 to MSBIA in Council discretionary funds and committed to provide $7,000 to MSBIA and each of the other BIDs in FY 2016-17.  In 2011, the Citys Buy Local program began providing partnership grant funds to the three BIDs of up to $1,500 annually. MSBIA has primarily used the Buy Local grant to help fund some of the Summer SOULstice marketing and promotion costs, as the event helps promote the Buy Local program. Additionally, the City established an Event Partnerships Administrative Instruction (AI) in 2015 that specified conditions and requirements for City sponsorship and co-production of community events. The AI authorizes the City to partner with organizations to provide funds, fee waivers, and use of City staff time for planning and implementation of qualified events. The value of the sponsorship or co-production varies. The City co-produced the 2015 SOULstice, and MSBIA received approximately $13,604 in City support comprised of the Council discretionary funds, Buy Local funds, fee waivers, fee reductions, and in-kind staff time. The City also co-produced the 2016 SOULstice, and MSBIA received $16,823 in City support which included allowing for an over-the-street banner, promotion of the event via the Citys social media outlets, fee waivers, fee reductions, and additional City fees associated with public safety staffing requirements. The value of the City resources provided to MSBIA is based on the actual cost of City fees and staff time.

The FAA has designated a local Airports District Office representative as the Citys point of contact with whom to consult in achieving the runway shortening provided for by the Consent Decree.  Vendor/Consultant SelectionOn February 1, 2017, the City issued a Request for Proposals letter (RFP #2500) for aviation planning and engineering services to shorten the runway at SMO to 3,500 feet per the Consent Decree between the FAA and the City of Santa Monica. The RFP letter was emailed to the two pre-qualified aviation consultants: Mead & Hunt and AECOM/Aeroplex. Subsequently, on February 3, 2017, the City issued Addendum No. 1 to RFP #2500 revising the Design-Bid-Build schedule in the original letter RFP, and requesting the consultants to also submit a Design-Build option with an expedited delivery schedule. Both consultants submitted proposals on February 15, 2017. Mead & Hunts proposal is for Design-Bid-Build with an option to construct the project under the Construction Manager at Risk (CMR) provisions. AECOM/Aeroplexs proposal is primarily focused on Design-Build. While the most aggressive completion dates in both proposals show the project being completed in December 2017, AECOM/Aeroplexs proposal offers a Design-Build option that would reduce the procurement timeline for construction services, with the possibility of completing the project at the earliest possible date. The schedules in both proposals are contingent on significant assumptions regarding the scope and time required to obtain important input in voluntary consultation with the FAA.  In addition, both proposals included provisions to pursue interim runway shortening strategies. The proposals were reviewed by a selection panel consisting of staff from the Airport, Civil Engineering, Public Works, and City Attorney's offices. Evaluation was based on the following selection criteria: experience, references, work plans, project team, cost, and delivery schedule.

Study Sessions", "body": {"other": "California Coastal CommissionIn response to Council direction, City staff met with key Coastal Commission staff on January 17, 2017 to discuss the concept for a temporary multipurpose sports field in the Civic Center. The purpose of the meeting was to introduce Coastal Commission staff to the concept of a temporary sports field in the Civic Center without construction of the underground parking associated with it in the Civic Center Specific Plan, and to ascertain the information that would be needed for them to evaluate this as a proposed temporary use which would cover more than 600 spaces in the existing surface parking lot. For purposes of the discussion, we assumed an 8-10 year lifespan for the temporary sports field. Coastal Commission staff indicated pursuant to the California Coastal Act, in evaluating projects they are responsible for considering whether the project creates an adverse impact to public access to the beach for recreational purposes. Additionally, they expressed concerns regarding mitigating the loss of parking and made it clear that any required mitigation would need to be implemented to coincide with the construction of the temporary field and that it would not be acceptable to delay mitigation of the loss of parking to a future permanent solution. They also expressed that they generally do not consider an 8-10 year timeframe as a temporary use. With this in mind, Coastal Commission staff indicated the following information would be required to consider such a request: 1)     Explanation of project phasing2)     Description of the playing fields purpose, potential users, and schedule of use3)     Explanation of a long-term plan for permanent subterranean parking and the percentage that would be associated with Civic Auditorium use4)     A comprehensive parking analysis would be needed to evaluate whether or not the temporary field, including the removal of existing surface parking, would impact coastal access. The analysis would need to evaluate parking utilization in the Civic Center surface parking lot, Civic Center parking structure, nearby beach parking lots, and nearby on-street parking by time of day and day of week over the proposed use period, and would need to analyze to what extent the removal of 600+ spaces would impact public access to the beach. The analysis would consider relevant aspects of Downtown parking utilization that could reasonably affect the Civic Center, but not necessarily all Downtown parking resources. Coastal Commission staff indicated the study would need to consider uses in the area as well as the impacts on the timing of decisions made regarding the future repurposing of the Civic Auditorium, and would expect the study to factor in all alternative modes of transportation including Transportation Demand Management (TDM) plans for all uses.  While Coastal Commission staff indicated their willingness to keep an open mind, they cautioned that a loss of parking that impacts beach access even if labeled as temporary could impact the timing for other improvements in the area and especially the repurposing of the Civic Auditorium. Lack of adequate parking availability could potentially preclude new activity, leaving the Civic dormant for many years in the future. They expressed reservations regarding allowing a use with this level of parking impact to commence without imposing requirements to offset or mitigate impacts to beach access, acknowledging that in their experience temporary uses can often become long-term given constituent support for them once in place. Further, Coastal Commission staff indicated they would also want to consider how to guarantee construction of permanent subterranean parking if a temporary field is constructed. They expressed concern that parking for Civic Center uses may be pushed into coastal lots and reduce beach users parking opportunities.  Coastal Commission staff indicated they will continue to consider and process applications for the Santa Monica Early Childhood Lab School (ECLS; formerly the ECEC) and the City Services Building (at such time as the application is filed) based on existing conditions as they accumulate; the field is not a submitted project at this time.  Potential Partnership with SMMUSDAt the November 28, 2016 Board of Education meeting (Attachment E), SMMUSD staff presented options and tradeoffs regarding using School Bond Measure ES funding to implement development of Phases 1 and 2 of the Samohi Campus Plan (SCP) Blue Plan or alternatively implement Phase 1 of the SCP and partner with the City to develop a permanent sports field and subterranean parking structure on the Civic Center site (Attachment F). The Board directed its staff to work with City staff to explore whether there are feasible financing options to implement all three of the projects concurrently (Phases 1 and 2 of the SCP and the field with parking) and directed its staff to return with an update on January 19, 2017. While several Board members present weighed in on their preferences should they need to choose between options, they expressed interest in receiving input from the PTA Council and possibly others before making a decision. It was also noted that it would be important for all Board members to participate in making this decision should it be necessary (Attachment G).  Subsequently, staff from the City and SMMUSD have performed due diligence for this potential partnership project including discussions with each institutions financial advisors and bond counsel. As outlined in Attachment F, it is estimated that this project would range in a rough order of magnitude cost of $80-85 million. While SMMUSD could contribute a portion of the necessary funds from the Districts ES bond measure that was approved by voters in November 2012, there is insufficient City funding available to fully fund the project. City staff recommend consideration of a general obligation (GO) bond requiring approval by two-thirds of local voters in November 2018 to provide the necessary City support for the project, along with other anticipated park projects such as the construction of the expansion of Airport Park and Memorial Park and potentially other anticipated park and recreation projects.  City and District staff continue to meet regularly to establish a recommended terms sheet for a partnership including matters such as financial contributions, management of design and construction, usage needs, and maintenance and operations responsibilities.  The City, in collaboration with the School District, will conduct an economic analysis of the project, considering such items as land value, construction, shared use, and maintenance, in order to establish a quantitative baseline for the permanent field cost sharing arrangement.  There are risks involved with each option. If the City were to move ahead with a temporary field, the City would lose approximately 600 spaces of parking and the associated revenue in the Civic Center. While some of this parking loss might be able to be absorbed within the Downtown area, there would be an impact on parkers who use this lot including employees, jurors and other visitors to the County Courthouse, Samohis staff, parents and students, City employees and visitors and downtown parkers. In fact we have received correspondence from the Superior Court of LA County expressing concerns about the possible loss of parking and the impacts that it would have on courthouse business (Attachment H). Additionally, as noted by Coastal Commission staff, a lack of parking would likely adversely affect any future negotiations with third parties for the repurposing and operation of the Civic Auditorium.  If the City were to move ahead with the School District partnership, it would likely complete the design of the permanent field before knowing the results of a GO bond vote in November 2018 in order to have a shovel-ready project. If the bond measure were to fall short, the funds necessary to design the field will have been risked. Both options would increase field maintenance and operational costs for the City at a time when the Citys five year financial forecast is showing a growing structural deficit. While both options present risks, the permanent field with parking below would be optimal for meeting the needs of the current uses in the area as well as the future use of the Civic Auditorium while providing a permanent solution for the multi-purpose field for use by SAMOHI teams and the general public as contemplated by the Civic Center Specific Plan.   Staff recommends that Council provide direction to continue discussions with SMMUSD staff on terms of a potential partnership. Staff would return to Council with final terms of a proposed Memorandum of Understanding at such time as parameters are further defined. Staff also recommends exploration of the scope and size of a potential Park General Obligation measure for the November 2018 ballot, including discussions with community stakeholders to assess support. Design Consultant SelectionPer the direction received from Council at the October 25, 2016 meeting, staff reissued RFP SP2461 for design services for the temporary Civic field. Bids were accepted from October 31, 2016 to November 30, 2016.  The RFP requested proposals for two scopes of work: a feasibility and concept design phase which would include preliminary outreach, programming of the site, initial concept design, and construction cost estimate; and a design services phase which would follow completion of the feasibility phase and Councils approval. Nine proposals were received and publicly opened on November 30, 2016. The proposals submitted ranged in total cost from $165,900 to $531,400. Staff from Public Works and Community & Cultural Services reviewed and rated the proposals based on selection criteria including fees, direct experience on similar projects, record performing public sector work, hourly rates for services, understanding of the projects scope, approach to the work, qualifications of staff and proposed project schedule. Based on the selection criteria, three design firms were short listed on December 21, 2016 - BFS Landscape Architects, BrightView Design Group and RJM Design Group Inc. (RJM). Following interviews on January 9, 2017, it was determined that RJM is the most qualified firm and best bidder based on the firms clear understanding of the project, track record of projects of similar scope, design team composition, previous experience with government agencies, fee structure and references. The multidisciplinary team assembled by RJM is comprised of professionals in the fields of landscape architecture, urban planning, park and sports field design, and civil, electrical and geotechnical engineering. Additionally, a member of the RJM team has recent extensive experience obtaining permits from regulatory agencies, including the Coastal Commission and the City of Santa Monica. RJM has completed the award-winning Bonita Creek Park renovation project in Newport Beach that included the addition of approximately four acres of synthetic turf, enhancing access and playability for softball and soccer fields; Chino Hills Community Park, utilizing synthetic turf surfacing and lighting for six multi-use sports fields accommodating baseball, softball and soccer; and sports field projects for several other California cities including Lake Forest, Ontario, El Segundo and Temecula. Given the Citys continuing discussions and potential partnership with SMMUSD, staff intends to proceed with entering into a contract with RJM only for the initial feasibility and concept phase at this time in the amount of $47,025 which is within the City Managers contract authority. This would allow the design for the temporary field to move forward while providing flexibility should the scope of the project broaden to a permanent multipurpose sports field with subterranean parking. The feasibility study would determine the viability of designing a softball field to overlay a synthetic turf multipurpose sports field which would be useful regardless of whether the project is ultimately built as a temporary or permanent field.  Staff will return to Council in June  2017 to present results of the feasibility study and at that time could request authorization for contract modification to include the full design phase portion of the contract in the amount of $203,973 (including a 10% contingency), depending on Councils future determination of the projects direction. Following modification, the proposed contract for the combined feasibility and design phases in addition to a 10% contingency would total $250,998. Alternatively, Council could direct staff to add an action item to a future meeting agenda to authorize award of a contract with RJM for both feasibility and design phases in the proposed total amount of $250,998 (including a 10% contingency).  Lastly, staff plans to return to Council to provide a quarterly status update in June 2017 to report on progress with the potential partnership with SMMUSD with the potential for seeking authorization to enter into an MOU, further discussions with Coastal Commission staff, and the status of the projects feasibility study. Civic Center Plan Amendment The Civic Center Specific Plan (CCSP) currently contemplates that subterranean parking will be constructed as part of the reconstruction of the east wing of the Civic Auditorium expansion. An amendment to the CCSP will be required if the City and SMMUSD elect to proceed with the permanent multipurpose sports field with subterranean parking under the sports field instead of as part of the Civic Auditorium expansion.  Environmental Analysis Under CEQA guideline 15262, a project involving only feasibility or planning studies for possible future actions which the City has not approved, adopted, or funded does not require preparation of an EIR or negative declaration. Future actions to implement either the temporary or permanent sports field will require environmental analysis before approval, adoption or funding.  ", "background": "On February 9, 2016 (Attachment A) staff presented the Civic Working Group Final Report and proposed next steps to Council. Council directed staff to explore the possibility of placing a temporary field at the corner of 4th St. and Pico Blvd., to work with partners such as SMMUSD and Santa Monica College on funding options and to return to Council the following May with cost estimates. At the May 24, 2016 Council budget study session (Attachment B), funding totaling $200,000 was identified in FY 2016-17 as part of the FY 2016-18 Capital Improvement Program (CIP) for design of the field.  Following considerable discussion and in response to public testimony, Council adopted a motion directing staff to earmark funds for the construction of the Civic Center multi-purpose sports field and to provide quarterly updates to Council on the status of the project to ensure that it moves forward as quickly as possible. The adopted FY 2016-18 CIP Biennial Budget includes $200,000 in FY 2016-17 for the design of the Civic Center sports field and the five-year CIP budget plan for FY 2016-17 through FY 2020-21 includes the use of reserve funds for the construction of the Civic Center sports field in FY 2018-19.  On October 25, 2016 (Attachment C) staff presented a quarterly update on the project at a Council study session. Following the presentation, staff was directed to:          Initiate a discussion with Coastal Commission staff regarding the temporary sports field project on the Civic Center parking lot and its resulting removal of approximately 600 spaces of surface parking;          Continue discussions with SMMUSD staff regarding a potential partnership project in the Civic Center to include subterranean parking and a permanent multi-purpose sports field with associated permanent amenities; and          Reissue the Request for Proposals (RFP) to a wider range of potential firms for the design of the temporary field in an effort to identify a fee proposal that is aligned with the $200,000 budget in the FY 2016-17 CIP budget. Staff proceeded per Councils direction and issued an Information Item on January 17, 2017 to provide Council with an interim progress update (Attachment D). ", "summary": "City staff has continued discussions with SMMUSD staff to explore a potential partnership that would develop a permanent multipurpose sports field on the Civic Center parking lot with two levels of subterranean parking and have broadly discussed terms that should be considered as part of such partnership if it were to move forward. Staff also met with Coastal Commission staff to obtain their input regarding the development of a temporary sports field on the site. Additionally, staff reissued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for design services for the temporary civic field and plans to award the feasibility and concept design portion of the contract at this time to RJM Design Group Inc.

Within these legal guidelines, the Citys Investment Policy and Investment practices have three primary objectives. In priority order, these are:         Safety  Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the Citys investment program. City investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio by diversifying its investments among a variety of securities offering independent returns.          Liquidity  City investments are kept sufficiently liquid to enable the City to meet all operating requirements which might be reasonably anticipated by structuring the portfolio so that securities mature concurrently with anticipated cash needs to the extent possible. Investments are primarily made in securities with active secondary or resale markets. Additionally, an adequate liquidity buffer is maintained for extraordinary circumstances.          Rate of Return  The Citys investment portfolio is designed with the objective of attaining a benchmark rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account safety and liquidity requirements. The benchmark may vary from time to time depending on the economic and budgetary conditions present. The City continues to abide by the highest professional standards in the management of public funds. While the investment strategy is flexible and can change based on market and economic conditions, the legal and policy guidelines governing these investment decisions remain relatively static. On an ongoing basis, staff reviews public fund investment best practices and regulatory or legal changes to ensure City compliance. Staff has reviewed the latest Local Agency Investment Guidelines Report issued by the California Debt and Investment Advisory Commission. There are no significant statutory changes requiring revisions to the Citys Investment Policy. Additionally, the Citys Investment Policy was recertified by the Association of Public Treasurers United States and Canada (APT & US&C) in October 2016. Wells Fargo BankAt its February 14, 2017 meeting, Council directed staff to completely divest from Wells Fargo Bank due certain disreputable business practices and its financing of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The City and Successor Agency have a number of relationships with Wells Fargo, ranging from banking services to investments. The following table lists the various relationships between the City and Successor Agency and Wells Fargo Bank.General Banking Services (7 bank accounts)3/31/2018 Not-to-exceed $750,000 over the five year term3rd Party Custodian for Citys investment portfolio30 days notice$11,000 per yearBroker Dealer ServicesUpon Notice$0 (compensation included in price offered for each specific investment transactionInvestmentsMaturing July 2020 and July 2021The Citys investment portfolio includes two Wells Fargo bonds with a total book value of $4.6 million.  Bank Loan (Successor Agency)Maturing January 1, 2018; To be paid off in full July 2017 (pending State DOF approval)$12.7 million remaining balanceCemetery/Mausoleum Perpetual Care Investment ManagementContract terminated November 2016N/A The City expects to be fully divested from Wells Fargo Bank within 12 to 13 months. While some divestments are immediate, others require a transition that includes competitive bidding for new services and complicated operational changes. The following is a proposed plan for the changeover:         General Banking Services  The Citys current contract with Wells Fargo Bank terminates on March 31, 2018. Changing banks providing general banking services is a very complex undertaking, requiring not just the movement of funds, but also changes to all the electronic payments to vendors, payroll direct deposits to staff, and purchasing card activities. It also includes changes related to deposits being made by checks, cash, credit cards, electronic payments from State, County, and Federal agencies, other on-line deposits that require new software integrations, and deposits from lockbox facilities. Converting to a new bank, from issuance of an RFP to the complete closure of all accounts with the old bank, can take twelve months. Staff has already begun working on the RFP for banking services and expects to issue it in March 2017.          Investment Portfolio Custodial Services  These services relate to investment transactions. The third party custodian acts as the agent to ensure all investment transactions are settled properly and holds all City investments in safekeeping. This contract can be terminated with 30 days notice by either party. However, converting to a custodian, from issuance of an RFP to the complete transition to the new custodian, can take three to five months. Staff will begin working on the RFP and should be able to issue it by mid-March with the goal of divestiture during the third quarter of 2017.          Broker/Dealer Services  As noted above, Wells Fargo Securities is one of six broker dealers currently in the Citys approved list to conduct investment transactions. This broker dealer agreement can be terminated at any time. Staff has stopped using the bank as a broker dealer immediately and will formally notify them of the termination of the agreement.          Investments  As noted above, the Citys investment portfolio includes two Wells Fargo bonds with a total book value of $4.6 million with maturity dates of July 2020 and July 2021. Based on the Council 2/14/17 motion that directed staff to sell the Wells Fargo bonds, staff has begun the process of selling the two Wells Fargo bonds in the Citys portfolio. Losses on the divestment of these bonds will be $120,000. No new Wells Fargo securities will be purchased for a minimum period of five years.          Bank Loan (Successor Agency)  The original amount of the loan was $60 million with a final maturity date of January 1, 2018; the balance to date is $12.7 million. The City is planning to pay off the remaining loan balance in July 2017 pending State Department of Finance approval. While many public agencies are considering actions regarding their relationship with Wells Fargo, the following jurisdictions have taken significant action:         State of California  In September 2016, State Treasurer John Chiang sanctioned Wells Fargo by suspending the purchase of Wells Fargo Securities, use of Wells Fargo as a broker dealer for investment transactions, and use of Wells Fargo as an underwriter for the negotiated sale of State bonds. The sanctions, put in place for one year, were in response to the certain fraudulent business practices that the bank was fined for.          County of Santa Cruz  In October 2016, Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors directed the suspension of any new business with Wells Fargo for one year due to certain fraudulent business practices that the bank was fined.          University of California  In January 2017, the University of California announced it will terminate $475 million in credit contracts with Wells Fargo over its ties to private correctional facilities.          City of Seattle  On February 7, 2017, the Seattle City Council voted to not renew a contract with Wells Fargo for Bank Depository Services beyond the initial term of December 2018. In addition, the Council action directed that the City will not purchase any new investments in Wells Fargo securities for a period of three years. The reasons for the divestment were Wells Fargo business practices and its financial support of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL).          City of Davis  On February 8, 2017, the City of Davis City Council voted to divest from Wells Fargo due to its financing of the DAPL as well as the scandal regarding its business practices. The City used Wells Fargo for general banking services and investment custodial services.          City of Alameda  Will consider divestment from Wells Fargo at its February 21, 2017 meeting for the same reasons as described above. Recommendations for Santa MonicaIn light of the Councils actions on February 14, 2017, staff recommends that the Council and Successor Agency approve revisions to the Citys Investment Policy changing Section 17(b), Socially Responsible Investing, to state that the direct investment of City funds is restricted as follows: No investments will be made in fossil fuel companies as defined by the organization 350.org or in banking institutions that provide financing to said companies and also adopt the attached resolutions that set forth the following course of action to divest the City and Successor Agencys assets from Wells Fargo Bank:         Issuance of a new Request for Proposals (RFP) for five years of new banking services with a qualified banking institution with a demonstrated commitment to and history of fair business practices, to take effect on or before March 31, 2018, the termination date of the City's current contract with Wells Fargo Bank;          Issuance of a new RFP for investment portfolio custodial services with a goal of divestiture from Wells Fargo by the third quarter of 2017;           Immediate termination of Wells Fargo Securities as the City's broker dealer;          Payment of the Successor Agency's outstanding loan obligations to Wells Fargo, pending approval by the State Department of Finance.           Disqualification of any banking institution that has been subject to a consent order for improper sales practices, placed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or other federal or state regulatory agency with jurisdiction to protect consumers from improper sales practices, from providing investment, debt, and/or banking services to the City if the consent order was issued within five years of the City's solicitation for such services.  ", "background": "Per State law, City Council annually considers and approves the Citys Investment Policy (Attachment A) and delegates investment authority to the City Treasurer for a one-year period.

An unmodified opinion communicates that the financial statements are fairly presented and that the information used in the report is reliable. In their written communications to Council, the auditors note that they encountered no significant difficulties with management in performing or completing the audit.  Additionally, they found no corrected or uncorrected misstatements. The CAFR was presented to the Audit Subcommittee of the City Council on January 17, 2017 by LSL. Subcommittee members were given an opportunity to review the report and ask questions of the external auditors. Among the topics discussed were the required communication and responsibilities of the external audit firm, significant changes to accounting policies as prescribed by GASB, the function of significant accounting estimates, and prior period adjustments. The Audit Subcommittee received and filed the CAFR with a 4-0 vote, with Committee Member Pam OConnor absent. The City of Santa Monica has received a clean, unqualified/unmodified audit report and the GFOA Award for 32 years, since the City first participated in the GFOA program in FY 1983-84. Overall, the Citys CAFR shows that City finances are stable. The following is an explanation of some key indicators reported in the CAFR. General Fund BalanceThe most notable measure of a Citys financial health is the General Fund balance. As presented in the Basic Financial Statements, the Citys General Fund assets exceeded liabilities by $387.1 million as of June 30, 2016. This balance is comprised of a number of categories, as follows:         $39.4 million nonspendable, restricted or committed resources that are required for specific purposes according to legal/contractual agreements or by ordinance or resolution of the City Council;          $280.3 million assigned funds set aside for specific purposes based on budget priorities (i.e., continuing and future capital projects; project financing equity; expenditure control budget; and pollution remediation); and          $67.3 million in unassigned funds as follows: o       $53.5 million rainy day contingency (15% of annual operating and capital expenditure budget); o       $9.7 million economic uncertainty reserve to mitigate potential revenue losses; o       $0.8 million unrealized gain; o       $3.3 million other unassigned fund balance. The strong fund balance and rainy day and economic uncertainty reserves play a key role in Santa Monicas AAA general obligation bond rating. In addition to being an indicator of very strong financial health, the high bond rating allows the City to pursue lower cost financing structures. The General Fund balance increased by $8.6 million over the prior year, primarily due to expenditure savings and an increase in charges for services, sales and use tax, other tax, and license and permit revenues. Citywide Net PositionThe Statement of Net Position, similar to a balance sheet, reports total assets and liabilities of the City as of June 30, 2016. The total net position of the City for all activities was $1.5 billion. Net position is broken out into three categories: capital, restricted, and unrestricted. Net Capital Position ($1.2 billion)Capital assets include land, buildings, improvements, intangibles, infrastructure and utility systems, and construction in progress. Intangible assets represent rights of use for items such as software and payments for Santa Monicas cost of improvements to the City of Los Angeles sewage treatment system. Some notable capital projects that were underway as of June 30, 2016 are:         California Incline and Pedestrian Overpass         Expo Light Rail Phase 2         Ishihara Park         City Services Building         Bus stop improvements         Enterprise Resource Planning system Restricted Net Position ($209.3 million)These assets are subject to agreements with creditors, developers, grantors, or laws or regulations of other governments. Approximately 46% of this amount is restricted for affordable housing and committed to various projects, 11% is restricted per federal, state and other grant regulations, 26% is restricted according to development agreement terms, and the remaining amount is restricted for the Cemeterys trust fund, debt service reserve, and other grant and legislative constraints. Unrestricted Net Position ($150.7 million)This represents the balance of net position that is neither part of capital assets nor restricted.  Healthy capital and operating reserves in the business-type activities support rate stabilization and recovery strategies for the Citys many activities. Long Term Debt and Pension LiabilitiesThe primary source of long term debt is in the form of bonds issued by the City. $12.4 million in debt service payments were made on one general obligation bond for the Main Library construction, five General Fund revenue bonds for various parking structures and the Public Safety Facility, and one revenue bond to fund a proportionate share of capital improvements of the City of Los Angeles Hyperion wastewater treatment facility. In July 2015, the City issued $26.4 million in bonds to refund the 2004 Public Financing Authority Civic Parking Structure bonds.  The City recognized an economic gain of $4.4 million on the transaction. More information on long term debt can be found in Note 9, page 77 of the CAFR. For greater transparency, beginning in FY 2014-15, new GASB pronouncements for pension accounting require that entities report unfunded liability in the financial statements rather than in the footnotes.  These GASB pronouncements do not affect either the amount of contributions a government makes to pension plans or the total net pension liability, which is still actuarially determined.  Total net pension liability, or unfunded liability, is based on projected future benefit payments attributed to the current and past employees service, less the assets accumulated to pay those liabilities.  As shown on pages 23 and 119 of the CAFR, the City has a combined unfunded actuarial liability of approximately $387 million: total pension liability of approximately $1.5 billion with plan assets of approximately $1.2 billion. The Citys various pension plans are thus approximately 75% funded.  The Citys annual payments include a portion to fund current benefits as well as an amount to pay down the unfunded liability.  Annual actuarial valuations provide the City with the amount of the contribution that must be paid annually into the plan to ensure that the current unfunded liability is paid off over the following 30 years. A detailed explanation of the Employee Benefits Programs including detailed pension information by plan is included in the Notes section (see Note 16, pages 92 through 104) and the Required Supplementary Information (pages 119 and 120). State-mandated pension reform and Council-approved cost saving measures mitigate pension cost increases. Furthermore, employees are currently paying approximately 25% of the total pension cost, and additional increases to public safety employee pension contributions are continuing in FY 2016-17 based on collective bargaining agreements.  Through Council action, the City has paid $31.3 million toward the Citys unfunded pension liability through the end of FY 2015-16. The City will continue its Counciladopted policy to pay down at least $1 million of its unfunded liability every year. Repayment of Successor Agency LoansAs part of the process of winding down the former Redevelopment Agency, the Department of Finance approved repayment of the three loans from the Successor Agency under the rules encompassed in Senate Bill (SB)107.  The City expects to receive payments totaling $70 million over a period of 8 years which have been committed to low and moderate income housing. Cash and InvestmentsThe CAFR also includes detailed information on the Citys cash and investments. As of June 30, 2016, the City had $783 million in total cash and investments, all of which are in the form of investments authorized by the California Government Code and the Citys investment policy or in compliance with bond indenture agreements. More information on cash and investments is found in Note 5, page 58 of the CAFR. CAFR Presentation to CouncilStaff and the Citys external auditor have presented the CAFR as an administrative item on the Council agenda since 2013. This was done as an alternative approach to the Los Angeles County Civil Grand Jurys best practice recommendation that the City establish an audit committee to oversee the work of the Citys auditor.  In 2015, Council established an Audit Subcommittee, which includes three Councilmembers and two members of the public with finance and accounting expertise. The Subcommittee has received presentations of the CAFR from the Citys external auditor for the past two years.  In recognition of the Audit Subcommittees prior review of the document, staff is seeking the Councils direction on whether to continue the process of a CAFR and independent auditor presentation to both the Audit Subcommittee and the full Council, or whether the CAFR may be presented to the Council as a consent item in future years. ", "background": "The CAFR communicates the Citys financial condition and activity in a transparent and organized manner and in compliance with accounting and financial reporting standards established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). The report presents historical and comparative information that can be useful to City staff, elected officials, and external users such as debt rating agencies, businesses, other public agencies, and the Citys residents. The most recent CAFR and over 10 years of prior year reports are available at the Citys libraries and on the Citys Finance website at: https://finance.smgov.net/budgets-reports. As required by the City Charter, financial statements are prepared by the City and audited by independent auditors. The City selects its independent auditor through a competitive procurement process. The Citys current independent auditor, LSL, is in its first year auditing the City. The quality of the Citys work and the CAFR is measured in two ways: (1) a clean audit report by the independent auditors; and (2) the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting, awarded by the Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA). The attainment of the latter is the highest form of recognition in governmental accounting and financial reporting. Auditors follow audit industry standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). These standards require auditors to provide an opinion on specific areas of the Citys financial statements based on observations, inquiries, testing of transactions, and analysis. The Citys CAFR includes the following major sections and information: ", "summary": "The Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) communicates the Citys financial condition and activity for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016.

This audit is performed in compliance with City Charter requirements. An attached submittal letter states that the Citys independent auditors encountered no difficulties, found no corrected or uncorrected misstatements, and had no disagreements with management during the audit. An additional report on the Citys internal control over financial reporting and compliance notes no instances of non-compliance. The City of Santa Monica has received a clean audit report for more than three decades and has been awarded the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting by the Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA) for its CAFR for 32 consecutive years since it began participating in the program. To make the CAFR more transparent, staff has provided an explanation for key financial performance indicators shown in the report. The Citys independent external auditors, Lance, Soll & Lunghard, LLP (LSL) presented the CAFR to the Audit Subcommittee on January 17, 2017.

That Goal anticipated exercising the power affirmed by Measure LC to replace the obsolete aviation uses at the physically-constrained site with a great public park encompassing public open spaces and recreational facilities along with compatible cultural, arts and education uses.  Over the subsequent year, the City took a number of legal and administrative actions to assert local control and minimize adverse health and safety impacts on the surrounding community. On August 23, 2016 the City Council adopted a resolution expressing the Councils intention to close the Santa Monica Airport to aviation use, as soon as that is legally permitted, with a goal of June 30, 2018 and, authorizing the City Manager to initiate all administrative measures necessary to implement the resolution (Attachment B).  In January 2017 the City agreed to enter into a Consent Decree with the United States of America and the Federal Aviation Administration that resolved all outstanding disputes between the parties, and relinquished all claims by the U.S. and the FAA. The Consent Decree allows the City to close Santa Monica Airport to aviation uses forever after December 31, 2028; mandates that the operational Airport runway length be shortened from just under 5,000 feet to 3500 feet; and includes other terms governing the operations of the airport until its closure.

On December 2, 2008 the Council approved contract #9016 with Fehr & Peers for the creation of a Santa Monica-specific Travel Demand Forecast Model, evaluation of existing and future land use and transportation scenarios for the Land Use and Circulation Element, and preparation of documentation for the Environmental Impact Report. The TDFM was created in 2008 and is unique to the City of Santa Monica. The model includes every street in the City and is calibrated and validated to local traffic counts. The TDFM is a model of existing traffic conditions and is used to project future traffic conditions for the LUCE horizon year of 2030 and the interim future year of 2020. Unlike less sophisticated transportation models, the TDFM contains a number of enhancements that allow it to capture the effects of the Citys LUCE land use policies, street improvements, and transportation demand management services and regulations. These enhancements include the effects of sustainable development patterns (e.g., complementary mix of housing and daily services and transit oriented development), streetscape design factors, active transportation networks, parking management, and transportation demand management (TDM) programs, as well as ridership of the Expo Light Rail. The TDFM has a base model for the entire City for AM and PM peak hours, and makes the following additional analytical capability and information available to decision makers:         A weekend mid-day assessment (Saturday model) for selected areas in the City such as the Downtown;                      Greenhouse gas emissions analysis;         Performance measures such as vehicle miles traveled per capita;         Trip generation rates by different types of land uses and geographic characteristics;         Information regarding regional pass-through versus locally-generated traffic on City streets; and                      Walking and bicycling demand by street segment. The TDFM is an essential tool for the City to monitor how the changes in land use coupled with transportation improvements, services and regulations may affect the Citys transportation performance and to forecast and plan for future transportation conditions in the City. The model is typically updated and recalibrated for optimal accuracy every 4 years. On July 9, 2013, Council approved contract #9764 with Fehr and Peers to perform an update and calibration of the TDFM. The TDFM was calibrated to reflect 2013 local and regional traffic and land use conditions.   TDFM UpdateMaintaining and updating the TDFM is an important part of the Citys measuring and monitoring program of the LUCE. It is also used to complete transportation analyses required for California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) compliance serving as the City's primary tool for transportation analysis of land use plans, development projects, and transportation projects. The TDFM needs to be updated periodically to capture the effects of new development projects, regulations, capital projects, services, and the Expo Light Rail on the Citys transportation network. Periodic updates to the TDFM helps the City better gauge the progress of transportation demand management measures, and to help determine appropriate improvements that are needed in the transportation network for people in all modes.  Since the TDFM was updated in 2013, there have been physical changes to the street network and changes in mobility options. In 2006, Metro began operation of the Expo Light Rail line connecting Santa Monica to Downtown Los Angeles, and major street improvements were completed such as the Colorado Esplanade and the California Incline Bridge. Additionally, in recent years, the introduction of transportation network companies (TNCs) such as Uber and Lyft, and car-sharing in the City (e.g.ZipCar and WaiveCar) have provided greater transportation choice. In summer and fall 2017, new vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian counts will be collected in the City. The TDFM will need to be updated to reflect changes in transportation conditions and land use changes in the City, and recalibrated against current counts.  Updating CEQA Analysis Pursuant to SB743In the next couple of years, transportation review required under CEQA will change as a result of the adoption of California Senate Bill 743 (SB743). SB743 will require the City of Santa Monica to adjust its CEQA-mandated analysis in the upcoming 1-2 years, following adoption of the Final Guidelines (anticipated in 2017). The States currently published draft CEQA Guidelines indicate that the City will be required to use VMT as the replacement metric for transportation analysis under CEQA. VMT measures the total distance traveled (in miles) between the origin and destination of a trip and as such, captures the full extent of vehicle travel on the roadway network (VMT = Trip Rate x Trip Length). VMT is a more appropriate metric for assessing transportation impacts on the environment, because it is related to greenhouse gas emissions, the development of multimodal transportation networks, and a diversity of land uses.  Currently, output data of the TDFM is used to generate Level of Service (LOS) analysis as formerly required under CEQA. To comply with the anticipated CEQA Guidelines under SB743, the TDFM will need to be calibrated to use VMT to assess transportation impacts. Furthermore, the City will have to establish new transportation review procedures and adopt new VMT-based traffic impact thresholds to replace the existing Level of Service (LOS) impact thresholds.  Update of Transportation Impact Fee Nexus StudyThe Citys Transportation Impact Fee nexus study (TIF) will be updated to be more consistent with analyzing projects based on VMT and to reflect additional projects identified since the adoption of the fee.  Vendor/Consultant SelectionThe City of Santa Monica's TDFM was developed by consultant Fehr and Peers in 2008. Fehr and Peers (F&P) was selected through a competitive process in 2008. The Citys TDFM is tailored to Santa Monica's physical, traffic and regulatory conditions (weekend peaks, TDM rules, etc.). Although the TDFM is owned by the City of Santa Monica, the City does not retain physical possession of the model as the City lacks the platform and technical skills to maintain and operate it. As the developer of the TDFM, Fehr & Peers has knowledge of the model platform, inputs and calculations that no other firm has.  Until last year, Fehr and Peers' offices were in Santa Monica which also provided an additional level of detailed local knowledge. The offices moved to Downtown Los Angeles, but assigned staff are still the same and highly familiar with the dynamics of Santa Monica traffic. In addition to local information, the model needs to incorporate adjacent areas to accurately reflect traffic conditions. Fehr & Peers is currently under contract to the City of Los Angeles to create their travel demand model.  Updating the TDFM will require use of the vehicle trip generation and trip length data from the City of Los Angeles' travel demand model, and therefore, per Section 2.24.080(d), Fehr & Peers is uniquely suited to perform the update to the City of Santa Monica's TDFM. Furthermore, Fehr & Peers has been actively using and managing the current TDFM since 2008 and retains the most current technical expertise in the model functions and development. Assuming that another firm would be interested in taking over calibration and management of the TDFM, the alternative of hiring another firm would compromise the consistency and efficiency of using the model. It would require additional staff and consultant cost to facilitate the transition of the model, check assumptions and use, and verify accuracy of output. Transition of the model at this point would result in potential inaccuracies and data loss, assuming that another firm has the capabilities to do the work.  Fehr & Peers also has created a TDM+ tool that enables the most efficient analysis of VMT consistent with upcoming CEQA changes required under SB743. Fehr & Peers is the proprietary developer of the TDM+ tool, which is a tool used to calculate project-level VMT impacts and to apply VMT reduction measures based on a variety of land use and TDM measures. The TDM+ tool is based on empirical data on the effectiveness of various land use and TDM strategies. The TDM+ tool will be essential in complying with SB743's requirement that the City calculate VMT for projects. The TDM+ tool is customized for localities, using input data such as land use mixes, transportation infrastructure, trip generation, etc. Santa Monica has a complex and unique TDM environment, and the TDM tools offered by Fehr & Peers in prior updates have been important during past model construction and update. Based on Fehr & Peers knowledge of Santa Monicas unique conditions and technical expertise in inputting data and maintaining the model, staff recommends the awarding of a sole source contract. Any future work would be subject to a bid process. ", "summary": " One of the imperatives of the adopted Land Use and Circulation Element (LUCE) is that the City manage and monitor the transportation system in ways that serve community goals. The City of Santa Monica Travel Demand Forecast Model (TDFM) was developed as part of the LUCE planning process and Environmental Impact Report. The model enables the City to forecast how changes in land use coupled with transportation improvements, services and regulations may affect the Citys transportation performance, and enables calculation of trip generation, transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions and vehicle miles traveled. The TDFM is an essential tool for the City to forecast and plan for future transportation conditions in the City, to perform the measuring and monitoring functions directed in the LUCE, and to complete transportation analyses required for California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) compliance. Maintaining and updating the TDFM is an important part of the LUCE measuring and monitoring program. The TDFM needs to be updated regularly to maintain accuracy and capture the effects of new development projects, capital projects, and changes to the transportation system. TDFM updates include incorporation of biennial citywide transportation counts, and recalibration and validation against the counts.  To comply with State mandated CEQA changes, the City will need to update the TDFM and implement regulatory changes to align the CEQA transportation impact methodology and thresholds with new state laws and policies, including SB743. The Citys Transportation Impact Fee would also be updated to be consistent with the TDFM update and project analyses.  Updating the TDFM and implementing SB743 regulatory requirements will require a sole-source professional services agreement with Fehr and Peers in the amount of $280,500.

Moore, to perform overall condition assessments of the structural slabs, curbing, vertical and overhead surfaces and waterproofing components in Parking Structures 2, 4, 5, 9 and 10. Parking Structures 1 and 3 were added through contract modifications. The condition assessments of these facilities included site observations, documentation of distressed conditions, and various testing of these elements ultimately compiled into a final assessment report. The final assessment report provides guidance for the repair work. Staff used the information compiled in the final assessment report to collaborate with the consultant in development of final construction documentation.  The final assessment report did not document any signs of structural instability in any of the Citys parking structures, however numerous lower priority deficiencies were identified. Staff emphasizes importance in taking a proactive approach in identifying and addressing issues as they arise in order to prolong the useful life of these facilities.  The final assessment report indicated that structural concrete slabs in many of the parking structures exhibit various types of cracking, which over time, may result in moisture intrusion and long-term corrosion within the slabs. Treatments would include concrete penetrating sealants, coatings, crack sealing, structural slab repairs and other defined measures, which would extend the useful life of the facilities. In addition, the report identified signs of water intrusion on the vertical walls of Parking Structure 9. Intrusion appears to come from pipe sleeves in the walls, exhaust airshaft, and cracks in the basement walls.  A key component of the final assessment report is the Capital Asset Management Plans (CAMPs), developed for each of the parking structures in order to provide a roadmap in making cost-effective decisions to maintain the assets over a 10-year period. CAMPs are used to organize, prioritize and itemize repair components identified during the condition assessment phase and documented in the final assessment report. Maintenance and repair items were divided into the following four (4) categories: High Priority Repairs Medium Priority Repairs Low Priority Repairs Enhancements High priority repairs include life safety and structural issues that need to be addressed in the short term. Medium priority repairs include implementation of waterproofing and other items in order to reduce the potential of future deterioration and extend the useful life of the parking structures. Low priority repairs are maintenance items that address the aesthetics and function of the garage (which consist mainly of painting repairs). Enhancements include the aesthetic and functional items (which consist of items like retrofitting existing lighting to LED lighting).  High priority and medium priority items need to be addressed within the first two (2) years of discovery. High priority and medium priority repair items are included in the current CIP program budget and will be implemented as part of this project. Additionally, there are select low priority repair items that will be included in the current CIP program and are within budget.

Staff contacted reference agencies listed by the recommended contractor to ascertain past performance on similar projects, including the City of Pasadena and City of Redondo Beach. Staff also verified with the Contractors State License Board that Slater Waterproofing, Inc. and its subcontractors licenses are current, active, and in good standing. Based on these criteria, Slater Waterproofing, Inc. is recommended as the best bidder for construction services of the Repairs to Parking Garages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10 Project.  Consultant Selection - Construction ManagementOn September 22, 2015, the City issued a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for construction management and inspection services for upcoming construction projects on the Citys online bidding website. A total of 1,674 vendors were notified and 124 vendors downloaded the RFQ. The City received 25 proposals. A selection panel of staff from the Public Works Department reviewed responses to the RFQ.  The evaluation was based on the selection criteria set forth in SMMC Section 2.24.073, with a specific review of: technical competence, staffing capability, project approach, past performance, dispute resolution, quality control, cost control, management services, customer service, and the ability to meet required time frames. The top five firms were placed on a pre-qualified list of construction management firms in the Parking Lots, Parking Structures, and Piers categories. The list includes Caltrop Corporation, Civil Source, Hill International, Psomas, and Swinerton Management & Consulting. The firms were invited to participate in the Request for Proposal (RFP) phase posted in January 2017. Based on the selection criteria set forth in SMMC 2.24.073, Psomas is recommended as the best qualified firm to provide construction management and inspection services based on its qualifications, cost of services, and its directly related experience in providing similar services for municipal agencies. Psomas has extensive knowledge and experience on numerous construction projects in the cities of Los Angeles, Long Beach, Irvine, Manhattan Beach, and Santa Monica. Services provided by Psomas would include continuous inspection of the contractors night work, verification and management of field changes and unforeseen conditions, monitoring and mitigation of construction impacts, attendance at periodic progress meetings, arranging for deputy inspections and materials testing, project document control, and public outreach. Public OutreachPublic outreach during construction of this project would be provided by the City and by the Citys construction management consultant as part of the construction management effort. Public outreach would include notifications distributed to adjacent properties and the surrounding community regarding the scope of the Project. Periodic updates would be posted on the Citys Know Before You Go (KBUG) website and Monday editions of the Santa Monica Daily Press.  Properties impacted by the project would receive two separate construction notices. The first general notice would be hand-delivered to properties adjacent to the proposed project two weeks prior to the start of construction. A second two-day notice would be subsequently hand-delivered to each adjacent property with detailed information regarding the planned construction activity, potential impacts, and contact information.  The notices would be prepared by Public Works staff and distributed by the contractor. The construction notices would also be posted in the parking structures adjacent to the elevators and near the structure entrances.  The Citys project manager would regularly update Downtown Santa Monica (DTSM) on the progress of the work and address any issues that community members bring to DTSM. City staff from Public Works and Parking Operations met with DTSM in March 2017 to discuss upcoming impacts and work restrictions on the contractor for this project.  Schedule and Parking Impacts Impacts to the public would involve the temporary loss of no more than 50 parking spaces per parking structure during the workday and no more than 25 parking spaces per structure over the weekends. An exception to this parking loss requirement would occur during deck sealing operations that would close the entire top level of the structure. In addition, Parking Structure 5 would be closed entirely for approximately five days since the sealing operations affect multiple levels. The reason for this closure is that a section to be sealed on level two of this parking structure is located within the circulation aisle that all vehicles must use to exit the structure. The sealant product has to be applied in three phases to allow adequate curing time, and the application cannot be phased in a way that would allow traffic to pass due to the limited width at certain areas within the structures. The design engineer and City staff have looked at numerous options and determined that closure of the structure is the best solution. The contractor must provide at least one week notice prior to any shutdowns and before beginning activities in a new structure, as only one structure would be worked on at a time. All work impacts ramps and drive aisles. Additional restrictions have been placed on the contractors work during the Pier Concert Series and the Wednesday Farmers Markets. No work would take place during the holiday season between Thanksgiving and New Years Day.  The project is anticipated to begin in September 2017. The project duration is 15 months, but since work would be suspended during the holiday season, the anticipated end date is March 2019.", "background": "The City of Santa Monica currently owns eleven parking structures, and maintains nine of them. Parking Structures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 and the Civic Center structure are maintained by the City while parking structures 7 and 8 are maintained by the Macerich Company (Attachment A). Alternative long-term uses are being considered by the City for Parking Structures 1 and 3, so these structures were not considered in the original repair scope of work. The Civic Center structure and Parking Structure 6 are relatively new structures, constructed in 2007 and 2013 respectively.  The original parking structures 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 were constructed in the 1960s. Parking Structures 4 and 5 were originally built as five story structures with the upper four-story additions completed later in the 1970s and 1980s. Parking Structures 2, 4 and 5 were seismically upgraded in 2010, 2009, and 2005, respectively, as these structures experienced some degree of damage after the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Parking Structure 9 (built in 2001) and Parking Structure 10 (built in the 1980s) were built as three and two level structures, respectively, with housing constructed on top of each.  In 2009, severe concrete cracking occurred at Parking Structure 3 prompting the City to inspect all City-owned parking structures. Multiple cracking locations were identified and subsequently repaired in all parking structures. Recently, these structures have shown signs of structural slab wear and distress due to long-term usage and exposure to the elements. Parking Structure 1 Structural IssuesParking Structure 1 was excluded from the original repair scope of work due to the uncertainty of its future use, as the City was considering future redevelopment of this site. However, on March 8, 2016, two large pieces of concrete fell from the bottom of the second level slab onto the City of Santa Monica Promenade Maintenance Office, located on the ground level of the structure. Due to the severity of the deficiencies near the office, emergency temporary shoring of the second level slab was implemented. A permanent structural repair solution would be installed as part of this project to remedy the issue. As a result, this structure was included in the design scope of work through a contract modification approved by City Council on May 24, 2016 (Attachment B).  Diagram 1 - Parking Structure 1 Structural issue Parking Structure 3 InclusionParking Structure 3 was also excluded from the original scope of work as private developers for Arclight Theatres have submitted a proposal to the City for the construction of a new movie theatre and mixed-use development, which would require the demolition of Parking Structure 3.  On April 26, 2016, the City Council directed staff to include Parking Structure 3 as part of the design and repair scope of the project in order to compare the financial impacts related to repair costs of the existing structure versus replacing the structure with the future redevelopment (Attachment C). The design and repair scope of work that was included for Parking Structure 3 was consistent with the original scope of work for the other structures in order to extend the immediate operational cycle life of the structure. Additional in-depth repair analysis, such as seismic retrofit analysis, was not included in this scope as further explained in the section below. The scope of work was added through a contract modification approved by City Council on May 24, 2016.  Parking Structure 1 and 3 Future Seismic RetrofitIn a follow up on Councils initiative to include seismic retrofitting of Parking Structure 3 as part of the design scope of the project, staff looked into the opportunity of incorporating seismic retrofitting analysis for both Parking Structure 1 and 3 into the design and construction scope of the project in order to compare these costs with the future potential redevelopment costs of these sites. Staff reached out to the projects structural consultant, Walter P. Moore, in order to obtain estimated costs to seismically retrofit each of the structures. Total budget for design and construction of both structures is anticipated to be $2.6 million with costs to be increased based on future consumer price index (CPI) and labor costs. Due to the uncertainty of the future uses of both sites, these structures had not been previously analyzed seismically.  With this uncertainty and limited knowledge of the proposed future uses of each site and costs associated with each proposed redevelopment, staff considers deferring cost comparisons until further information about these potential redevelopments becomes available in order make a more informed decision on whether or not to incorporate seismic retrofit capital investments to these assets. Also, because of budgetary limitations and to avoid delays to the current project improvements, seismic retrofit improvements would best be accomplished as separate capital improvements when funding has been identified and when further information is obtained about future redevelopment of these sites. Should Council decide not to pursue the potential redevelopment of PS1 and PS3, Council could ask staff to consider the implementation of the seismic retrofit work at PS1 and PS3 in the upcoming Capital Improvement Program Budget cycle. ", "summary": "The Citys parking structures are a vital public asset and their continued operation and functionality are an essential service of the City. In 2009, severe concrete cracking occurred at Parking Structure 3 prompting immediate repair of the problem and inspection of all City-owned parking structures. Based on these inspections, the City identified Parking Structures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9 and 10 as candidates for repairs. The primary structural elements that would be repaired include the structural slabs, concrete walls and columns, and vertical walls situated below grade that have shown signs of waterproofing issues.

Prior to the changes, the Pier Restoration Corporation Board was responsible for approving prospective tenants and associated leases.  During the current review of the Guidelines and in discussion with the Pier Corporation Board, staff noted that the delegation of authority differs between the Pier and the Downtown Guidelines. The current Council-approved Downtown Guidelines delegate authority to negotiate leases and licenses to the City Manager, pursuant to a favorable recommendation regarding tenant selection and general business terms by the Downtown Santa Monica, Inc. (DTSM) Board of Directors.  Recommendation by the DTSM Board is intended to ensure that there is public participation and transparency in the selection of tenants, while relieving tenants of the more cumbersome process of going through a public hearing before the City Council. To improve efficiency and to ensure consistency among bodies, as well as to recognize the qualifications and commitment to the Pier of the Pier Corporation Board of Directors, staff seeks Council authorization to amend Section 13 of the Pier Guidelines to delegate authority to the City Manager to negotiate and execute leases or license with terms over 36 months and up to 25 years with a favorable recommendation of the Pier Corporation Board. The City Manager would continue to retain authority to execute leases and licenses with terms of 36 months or less. Council authorization would be required for any proposed lease terms greater than 25 years. The proposed language is consistent with the Downtown Guidelines with two exceptions. First, the Downtown Guidelines do not address lease terms of greater than 25 years because leases with such terms would not be expected within the City-owned spaces Downtown. (Longer-term leases are typically associated with significant capital improvements, which has occurred with free-standing restaurant spaces on the Pier where the spaces have been completely rebuilt. Spaces in the Downtown typically require less significant tenant improvements as they are contained with larger buildings such as parking structures or pavilions). Second, the City Managers authority to negotiate leases and licenses of less than 36 months relates to the vending carts on the Pier. Given the short terms of the cart licenses and micro-entrepreneurial nature of the cart business, requiring the extended public review process associated with longer-term leases would be expected to reduce the breadth and scope of micro-businesses that would pursue such opportunities. There are no City leases of less than 36 months Downtown, as the vending carts are operated pursuant to a longer-term master lease.  Under the proposed changes, the City would continue to administer tenant recruitment of available opportunities through an open and public process as set forth in the Guidelines, and continue to be responsible for lease negotiation and contract administration. All leases and licenses would be prepared and approved as to form by the City Attorney. The proposed modifications to the Pier Leasing Guidelines are shown in the attached redline version (Attachment D) and clean-copy version (Attachment E). City Policy on Business with Arizona Firms Section 8.4 of the Pier Guidelines references the Citys former policy regarding business with Arizona-based firms.

The study analyzed the distance between the Beach House and the Pier (1.4 miles or a 28-minute walk) and identified three potential playground sites: 810 PCH, 1038 PCH and 1200 PCH. 810 PCH was recommended as the best location for the North Beach Playground Project due to its adjacency to public restrooms and two convenient points of access (the 810 PCH parking lot and the Montana Avenue pedestrian overpass from Palisades Park). The Montana Avenue site is located approximately 1 mile from the Pier.  The North Beach Playground Project would activate this beach area for both visitors and north side residents by providing play equipment to this area. An additional advantage to the Montana Avenue site is the playground would be located east of the bike path, allowing families and children to avoid crossing the bike path in order to reach the playground. Historically, this site previously had play equipment; however, most play pieces were removed due to bad condition.

Both devices are Android-based devices that would utilize secure connections that meet or exceed FBI requirements for criminal justice data security.  The proposed mobile devices would enable staff to access systems such as e-mail, time keeping, scheduling, and policy management in the field. The ability to access these systems from the field would decrease the amount of time staff spends performing administrative tasks at the Public Safety Facility. The proposed mobile devices provide full cellular phone capability, which enables officers to more efficiently communicate with the public, support the ability to access specialized systems used by Police, including the capability to:  Receive real-time call-for-service information from the CAD system, and provide status updates for responses to the CAD system.  Perform queries via the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (CLETS) of various Department of Justice databases to identify wanted persons and vehicles. Traditionally, the queries of these databases require officers, who do not have ready access to a mobile computer equipped vehicle, to utilize their portable radio to perform the query via the Communications Center (Public Safety Dispatch). The handheld devices would enable officers to scan a persons driver license or identification card and immediately perform the query without entering any data or communicating over the radio system.  Capture field contact information and transmit the information directly into the Records Management System. The current method of documenting field contacts requires officers to manually write on a small pre-printed card, which is routed to the Records Unit for data entry, a process that can take days to complete.

The capture of the field contact information via the proposed mobile devices would enable the Police Department to begin reporting data associated with Assembly Bill 953.  Issue all three forms of citations issued by various Police Department staff including traffic citations, parking citations and administrative citations. The issuance of citations will require the purchase of mobile printers. The Police Department and Information Systems Department are in the process of evaluating mobile printer solutions for a future purchase.  Capture digital evidence such as photographs and videos, and securely transfer the digital evidence to the Police Departments Digital Evidence Management System. The current method of digital evidence capture requires officers to utilize a small camera and then manually transfer a memory card to the Forensics Section to upload to the Digital Evidence Management System. The proposed mobile devices are highly rugged and durable.

Staff determined that the costs to lease the equipment over a five-year period would cost between approximately 15% more than purchasing the equipment. A primary factor causing the lease costs to be higher than the purchase costs, aside from interest, is that the equipment would be considered obsolete at the end of the five-year lease and there would be almost no residual value. Since the technology has no real value at the end of the lease, the lease pricing runs higher making purchase the equipment a better option for the City. ", "background": "The Police Department has a long history of utilizing mobile computers in police vehicles which dates back to the mid-1990s.

Of the 195 active home-sharing business licenses, 37 business licenses are for guest houses, or 19%.  When the home-sharing ordinance was adopted, the application and registration process was intentionally made as simple as possible to encourage voluntary registration. This was based on the research of other cities that were experiencing difficulty in getting hosts to register. This included: no special permitting fees, a streamlined application process, and no on-site inspections. When the program was launched staff did on occasion conduct exterior visual inspections of properties primarily as an educational tool.

During the first reading of the proposed ordinance, Council directed staff to include language restricting the use of an Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) for a residential rental of 30 days or less. According to the record, Councils direction was intended to prevent a newly constructed ADU from being used as a Vacation Rental, as defined by the Santa Monica Municipal Code (SMMC). The ordinance was adopted on Second Reading on February 28, 2017 and effective March 30, 2017. However, Santa Monica Municipal Code Section 6.20.020 provides that if any provision of Chapter 6.20 conflicts with any provision of the Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 6.20 shall prevail. As such, in order to fully effectuate Councils direction, it is necessary to also amend Chapter 6.20 SMMC. "}, "title": " Home-Sharing and Accessory Dwelling Units", "Sponsors": null, "recommendations": ["Relating to Accessory Dwelling Units and Vacation Rentals and a Clarification of the Definition of Vacation Rental."], "Department": "Planning and Community Development"}], [{"Category": "08. Administrative Item", "body": {"other": "Following the completion of the Advisory Committees work, staff requested that the Worthe Team update the preliminary plan and financial projections based on the recommendations of the Advisory Committee. The Worthe Groups revised preliminary plan addresses most of the Advisory Committees recommendations regarding uses and square footage, while preserving four of the five buildings (Buildings A, B, E, and F). However, the Worthe Groups revised preliminary plan includes a hotel, which is described further in the report. The preliminary plan proposes six new buildings (Buildings C, D, G, H, I, and M) providing additional space for galleries and nonprofit cultural uses, a museum, a community center, restaurant/caf space, and creative office space, as well as a hotel that would include additional space for galleries and restaurant/caf uses. Removal of the on-site surface parking would create over three acres of flexible open space for cultural events, community programming, and use by the public and tenants. Table 1 below outlines the types of uses, associated square footage of each plan, and compares the Worthe Groups original proposal responding to the Citys RFP, the Advisory Committees recommendations, and the Worthe Groups revised plan based on the Advisory Committee process.

Following the massing site plan illustration is a discussion of each type of use included in the revised preliminary plan for the Site, as well as a description of the Advisory Committees review and recommendations.     Illustration 2  Revised Preliminary PlanMuseum Space  Building MThe Worthe Group originally proposed the museum space to be located immediately adjacent to the Expo Station in a newly constructed 21,100-square-foot, two-story building. Based on the Advisory Committees review and recommendation, the museum concept was revised to be composed of two buildings above ground totaling 9,000 square feet with an additional 12,100 square feet of below-grade space to connect the two buildings above ground. The Advisory Committee felt that a single, two-story building as originally proposed might create a visual and physical barrier between the Expo Station and the Site. During the review process, the committee recommended that the building include a minimum 1,000 square feet (up to 2,000 square feet) of food- service space for coffee and carry-out food options to serve museum patrons, Expo riders, area workers, and local residents. Pursuant to zoning ordinance standards, below-grade museum space would not count towards the projects floor-to-area ratio. Gallery and Nonprofit Cultural Uses  Buildings A, B, C, D, E and FThe Advisory Committee evaluated the amount of existing building space at the Arts Center utilized by gallery and cultural uses, as well as what the Worthe Group originally proposed. The committee initially recommended that a minimum of 61,600 square feet be dedicated to galleries and nonprofit cultural uses, excluding the museum. Later in the process, the committee recommended increasing the amount to 65,700 square feet and that two separate, 3,000-square-foot spaces for nonprofit performing arts uses be a part of the Arts Center. The committee further recommended that City Garage, the nonprofit theatre group that is currently located at the Arts Center, be prioritized for one of the two performing arts spaces. The committee also recommended that priority of leasing opportunities be offered to existing tenants of the Site first, followed by tenants of the privately owned portion of Bergamot Station when space is available. As the conceptual site plan was revised, the gallery and nonprofit cultural uses were designated to be located in the existing buildings on the Site (Buildings A, B, E and F) as well as in the ground floor of two of the new buildings proposed on the Site (Buildings C and D). Creative Office  Building CThe proposed creative office space provides a revenue stream to help subsidize the museum, gallery, and nonprofit cultural spaces at the Arts Center and helps support the ground-lease payment to the BBB. The Worthe Groups original proposal included 44,000 square feet of creative office space in two new buildings of two stories in height located at the southeast corner of the Site adjacent to City Yards and Agensys. The Advisory Committee recommended that the amount of office space be reduced by 14,000 square feet to a total of 30,000 square feet and be located in only one new building (Building C). To maximize the open space and prioritize the art uses throughout the Site, the Advisory Committee recommended that the office use be located in the two upper floors of Building C with the 15,000 square feet on the ground floor committed to gallery and nonprofit cultural uses.  Restaurant and Caf Spaces  Buildings G and MThe Advisory Committee recommended that the proposed enclosed restaurant and caf space of 5,000 square feet be located in the center of the Site in a new structure (Building G) with the benefit of outdoor dining space in order to help activate the Arts Center. The committee further recommended that up to 2,000 square feet of grab-n-go caf and coffee bar space be located in the museum building (Illustration 2), with the understanding that outdoor dining space would not count toward the projects floor-to-area ratio.  Community Center with Adjacent Open Space  Building IThe Advisory Committee advocated for increasing the amount of building space dedicated for community space from the originally proposed 2,000 square feet to 4,000 square feet in a new structure (Building I). The revised preliminary plan includes a centrally located community center with connecting open space of up to 10,000 square feet to allow for a fluid connection of indoor/outdoor activities, including community art exhibits, workshops, film and music events, and other events for the community. The community center is proposed for the center of the Site, adjacent to the restaurant, in order to serve as an overflow food venue for larger-scale events when needed. Arts-Related Uses  Building DThe Advisory Committee recommended that the originally proposed creative office building be redesigned into two new structures (Buildings C and D) and that Building D be focused on arts-related uses instead of creative office. The Advisory Committee endorsed Building D for market-rate arts-related uses on the second floor, totaling 9,000 square feet, with the ground floors 9,000 square feet dedicated to gallery and nonprofit cultural uses of which 4,100 square feet be at market rate with the remainder of the gallery and nonprofit cultural space be provided at below market rate.   Bike CenterThe Worthe Groups original proposal included a 4,600-square-foot bike center to be located in the center of the Site. The Advisory Committee expressed concerns regarding the proposed location, size, potential demand and prospective users. The Advisory Committee ultimately recommended a bike center of 600 square feet to be located in the shared parking structure or toward the south side of the Site near Michigan Avenue. Hotel  Building HThe Bergamot Area Plan identifies preferred use concepts for the Arts Center, which includes a hotel with a restaurant or caf that could serve as an amenity for the Arts Center and larger Bergamot Area and help activate the Arts Center beyond standard gallery operating hours. The hotel would also provide an economic benefit to the City/BBB, even though the expected ground lease revenue would be constrained due to the limited allowed FAR and the large amount of subsidized uses planned for the Site. The preferred concept suggests a location at the western edge of the Site adjacent to 26th Street. The RFQ/RFP issued for the Arts Center referenced the preferred use concepts, including the hotel, which was part of all three proposals submitted for revitalization of the Site. The Worthe Groups original proposal included a seven-story, 120-room, art-centric boutique hotel in the range of 80,000 to 83,000 square feet that included a roof-top bar, restaurant, conference room, and ground-floor art uses with subterranean parking spaces to serve the hotel guests and employees. The hotels height was originally proposed at 86 feet, the maximum permitted height under the Bergamot Area Plan.  The Advisory Committee spent several meetings reviewing the original proposed hotel use and related financial projections and asked the Worthe Group to evaluate the financial feasibility of a reduced-scale hotel of 80 rooms and 4 to 5 stories. In response, the Worthe Group analyzed a smaller hotel concept and determined that a hotel under 100 rooms would not be economically viable to operate or finance within the overall project, the limited market of hotel brands that service less than 100-room hotels and the inefficiencies of operating a hotel of that size. Advisory Committee member Richard Peterson who was with the Santa Monica Travel and Tourism organization at the time acknowledged to the committee that this was his understanding of hotel operations as well. However, the Worthe Group presented a reduced hotel concept of six stories, 100 rooms with 70,800 square feet of building area at a height between 65 feet to 75 feet. The Advisory Committee approved the 100-room, six-story hotel use as presented with the understanding that it would be classified as a Tier 2 project within the zoning policies of the Bergamot Area Plan. The proposed location of the hotel was located on the west side of the Site adjacent to 26th Street in the location of the existing T Building.  At the following Advisory Committee meeting, the committee rescinded their previous approval upon confirming with staff that the 100-room, six-story hotel concept of 65-75 feet would be classified as a Tier 3 development under the Bergamot Area Plan because it would exceed the 60-foot height limit for Tier 2 projects. The Worthe Group and Advisory Committee evaluated a five-story hotel with a 100 rooms, but both parties agreed that expanding the footprint of the hotel to achieve a 5-story concept with 100 rooms was too impactful to the Sites open space and view corridor. A majority of the Advisory Committee members ultimately voted against a 65- to 75-foot hotel at the Site. A majority of the Advisory Committee had concerns regarding the hotel based primarily on the following three elements:          that hotel construction would have severe impacts on the Arts Center businesses and operations,           that the hotel would not be synergistic with the Arts Center, and          that the proposed height of six to seven stories would overshadow and be out of scale with the Site. A minority of Advisory Committee members (five of the eleven members) supported the hotel, noting the additional services and economic benefits the hotel would bring to the project, including unionized jobs for local residents, transient occupancy tax revenue to support City and BBB operations, additional dining and nightlife amenities for nearby residents and workers, synergies with Art Center uses including additional gallery and event space, and proximity to the Expo station to serve transit users.  Both hotel concepts (a six-story, 100-room project or seven-story, 120-room project) evaluated included 2,000 square feet of restaurant space and 3,000 square feet of gallery or event space, resulting in a modest increase in both uses on the Site.  If the hotel or an alternative use/building for the proposed location is not included in the Art Centers preliminary plan, the T Building and its approximately 11,214 square feet of the building space would be retained. The Advisory Committee did not evaluate or recommend a use for the T Building space, though staff assumes that the space would continue to be made available for gallery and nonprofit cultural uses. Building PreservationThe Advisory Committees recommendations preserves five buildings (approximately 52,900 square feet of existing building space) on the Site, recognizing that the existing A Building would be partially demolished by approximately half to accommodate the new C Building. The Worthe Groups revised preliminary plan would require demolition of the T Building to accommodate the proposed hotel, in which case four buildings (approximately 41,700 square feet of existing building space) would be retained. Open Space and ParkingThe Site has abundant open space which serves the Art Center as a surface parking lot currently. The Advisory Committee recommended that the surface parking be retained until replacement parking is built off site, with the exception of implementing modest landscaping, open space, or other site modifications. Additionally, the committee recommended that the Worthe Group reserve as much peripheral surface parking on-site as needed for the existing galleries and nonprofit cultural uses to conduct business. The Worthe Group proposes to provide the code-required amount of parking for the Arts Center in the proposed shared City Yards Parking Garage, while maintaining a limited amount of on-site surface parking for disabled parking and loading requirements. The Worthe Group would be obligated to finance or lease the Arts Center parking in the proposed shared City Yards Parking Garage. Once the off-site, replacement parking is constructed, the reclaimed open space that totals over three acres, is envisioned to be integrated into the overall Site as a public gathering space that can used for a wide range of art, cultural, and community events. Advisory Committees ReportThe Advisory Committee concluded its efforts by adopting a Bergamot Advisory Committee Recommendation Report that summarizes the committees review, financial projections, and recommendations, as well as positions of the minority vote. The Bergamot Advisory Committees report was provided to Council on May 17, 2016 (Attachment F) and posted on the project website (www.smgov.net/Bergamot). The Advisory Committee also made recommendations addressing key project deliverables such as parking management, construction phasing, infrastructure and site improvements, and the Arts Center management plan.  If Council authorizes continuing forward with a preliminary plan, the Worthe Group would be required to prepare architectural plans, finalize financial pro-forma analysis, and prepare related key project deliverables, which would be incorporated into the development agreement and ground-lease contracts. Economic and Fiscal Impacts Recognizing the overall duration of the project to date, starting with the initial qualification submissions in 2012 through the Advisory Committee review process in 2015/2016, staff requested that the Worthe Group update its financial pro-forma for the revised preliminary plan based on current costs and rental rates. The Citys financial consultant, Keyser Marston Associates, Inc. (KMA), reviewed the updated financial pro-formas, analyzed whether the preliminary uses could support the proposed ground-lease payments and construction costs, and estimated the amount of public revenues that the City would receive annually from revitalization of the Site. Project Pro-formaWhen the Advisory Committee conducted their review of the Worthe Groups concept plans, the financial estimates were based on the original proposals cost estimates from 2013. Construction and financing costs have been updated by the Worthe Group and are incorporated in an updated financial pro-forma (Attachment G). The estimated construction costs for the revised preliminary plan without the hotel have increased by approximately 11 percent (from $22.2 million in total hard and soft costs to $24.6 million) and the updated pro-formas now include the combined possessory interest and property tax expenses that the plan is expected to incur. The rental revenue cash flows were also updated to reflect the below-market rents the Art Center tenants currently pay adjusted for consumer price index, and the phasing of the plan. The revitalization of the Arts Center requires significant financial investment in order to upgrade the Sites infrastructure and existing buildings, and to construct the new improvements and a shared parking structure. The total estimated costs of the revised preliminary plans are $39.6 million for the plan that does not include a hotel and $95.1 million for the plan that includes a 120-room hotel. Using Worthes assumptions, staff asked KMA to model the cost to construct a 100-room hotel, which KMA estimated at $85.7 million. Net cash flow from the plan without a hotel before consideration of debt service and return on capital is estimated to be approximately $2.2 million in the first year of full build-out and approximately $6.4 million in the first year of full build-out for the plan with a 120-room hotel. Net cash flow is expected to grow over time as revenues grow. When debt service and return on capital are considered, the plan without a hotel is not expected to repay the capital investors until 2058. The plan with a hotel is not expected to repay the capital investors until 2045. Assuming a 55-year ground lease, the net present value of the net cash flow after debt service and repayment of capital, assuming a 10 percent discount rate, is $4.5 million for the plan without a hotel and $25.8 million for the plan with a hotel. The net present value provides a means to estimate the Worthe Groups estimated profit over the life of the ground lease.  It should be noted that the financial pro-formas are preliminary, order-of-magnitude estimates used to test the feasibility of the land-use scenarios. If the plan moves forward, KMA would complete a detailed financial evaluation of the plan as it is further defined. During the preliminary phase, staff asked KMA to provide initial feedback on the Worthe Groups pro-forma. KMA comments include:         The loan-to-capital ratio of 65 percent is low compared to most commercial developments, which typically leverage a greater amount of debt. The Worthe Group has responded that they are able to attract a greater amount of capital to their plans.          The net developer profit is low compared to the overall size of the development. The Worthe Group has responded that they are able to accept lower overall returns because of their long-term investment horizon.          The time period for repayment of the initial capital investment is extremely long, particularly in the scenario without a hotel. The Worthe Group has responded that their investors are accustomed to longer windows of return on investment, though they acknowledge that the extended time period for the plan without a hotel would face greater challenges in attracting capital.          Based on the Worthe Groups Operating Pro-forma and Cash Flow Projections, KMA confirmed that the Worthe Group has the capacity and access to capital to finance the different preliminary plan uses being considered.  While the City could take the position that financing is purely a developers risk, if the Worthe Group is unable to attract debt and capital financing, revitalization of the Arts Center might be delayed.  In addition, the Worthe Groups pro-forma assumes that the developer would construct and operate a shared parking structure at the City Yards. Staff believes the concept requires significant further discussion and negotiation between the City and the Worthe Group if the plan moves forward. Estimated Public Revenues Attachment H identifies estimated annual City revenues of the revised preliminary plan. As noted in Attachment H and highlighted in Table 2 below, the annual City revenues from a preliminary plan without a hotel would generate approximate $1.3 million in annual City revenue. Annual City revenues from a preliminary plan that includes a 120-room hotel use is approximately $2.9 million. KMA estimated the annual City revenues from a hypothetical 100-room hotel at approximately $2.6 million. The most notable difference among the scenarios are the estimated property tax and transient occupancy tax revenues related to a hotel.  Table 2 - Annual Estimated Revenue to the CityGround Lease Payment$700,000$700,000$700,000Transit Occupancy Tax $0$1,226,000$1,472,000City Share of Property Taxes $55,000$119,000$132,000Total Estimated Tax Revenue to Citys General Fund $640,000$1,933,000$2,195,000 Lastly, the Worthe Group has committed to a minimum ground rent of $700,000 under each scenario; however, annual ground rent payments are typically equal to a percentage of the supportable land value. If the plan moves forward, KMA would develop a detailed evaluation of the refined plan and its financial pro-forma, in order to support negotiation of a ground-lease structure and profit-sharing opportunities associated with the market-rate uses.  Market-Rate Uses and Below-Market-Rate UseAn early policy direction that was included in the RFQ/RFP was the intent of preserving gallery and nonprofit cultural uses at the Arts Center. The City envisioned that the rental rates for cultural uses would be provided at below-market rates, with the recognition that nonprofit arts and cultural space would be discounted at a higher rate than for-profit gallery space. Likewise, it was envisioned that the Site would accommodate market-rate uses such as creative office, restaurants, and a hotel to help offset the below-market rents of the art spaces. The Worthe Group has maintained these lease rate expectations in their financial pro-forma analysis that they have produced throughout the process. The Advisory Committee recommendation limits the market-rate uses on the Site to 31 percent of the total building square footage, with the remaining 69 percent of the building space at below-market rates. The revised plan by the Worthe Group that includes a 120-room hotel adjusts the balance of building space to 43 percent subsidized space and 57 percent market-rate use. KMA notes that a balance, at a minimum closer to a 50/50 split of below-market and market-rate uses would be more sustainable for the plan by providing more reliable and diverse long-term income to support the below-market uses. A hotel could also support the Art Center tenants by providing a regular stream of visitors to the Site, including supporting restaurants that could incorporate evening service beyond typical gallery hours.  Council Guidelines The Advisory Committee was thoughtful in considering the Councils guidelines in their recommendations regarding the preliminary plan and mix of uses. The following section briefly discussed each of the Councils guidelines for the revitalization of the Arts Center with respect to the Advisory Committees recommendations. Minimize displacement and disruption to the fine art galleries and other creative businesses on the Site  Retention of existing Bergamot tenants is a priority shared by all participants. The Advisory Committees recommendations related to phased construction, temporary relocation options, leasing priority for displaced tenants, off-site parking, and outreach and signage during construction all speak to minimizing impacts on existing tenants. A majority of the Committee also voted against inclusion of a hotel on the Site, which would further minimize disruption, and likely continue to make Building T available for existing creative tenants. Incorporate space for additional nonprofit arts and cultural uses - The Advisory Committees recommendations would allocate the amount of space available for nonprofit arts and cultural uses by up to 65,700 square feet. If Building T were retained as cultural-focused space, an additional 11,214 square feet could be available for nonprofit cultural uses.Support the Expo Station and bus integration through amenities and services (e.g. public restroom, bike center)  The Advisory Committee envisioned the museum and adjoining caf as a prominent gateway, helping to visually promote and integrate the Arts Center with the Expo Bergamot Station. Although reduced in size from the original Worthe Group proposal, the Advisory Committee also recommended a bike center of 600 square feet in the preliminary plan.  Add a permanent home for a museum or other significant cultural institution  The Advisory Committee recommended a 21,100-square-foot museum building adjacent to the Expo station. Generate a minimum of $622,000/year ground lease payment, to be increased over time as a revenue source for Big Blue Bus  The Developer has proposed to set the annual ground rent at $700,000 for each of the three plan scenarios.  However, these amounts may be revised up or down based upon further feasibility testing once a more detailed development program is approved. Generate additional municipal revenues that could be used to supplement Big Blue Bus funds.  The role of the Site as a BBB revenue-producing asset adds additional complexity to the overall plan. BBBs revenues come from a variety of sources, including federal, state, and regional funds, farebox revenue, advertising, and real estate income. When Council voted to increased BBB fares in 2010, Council recognized that higher bus fares have a disproportionate impact on transit-dependent riders who are often at the lowest end of the economic spectrum. Recognizing the impacts, Council directed staff to explore opportunities to maximize returns on BBB real estate in order to reduce pressure on bus fares. Bergamot Station represents one of BBBs primary real estate holdings. If the Citys overriding goal were to maximize ground rent in order to reduce pressure on the BBB fares, significant ground rents could flow to the BBB from a long-term re-positioning of the property. For example, the Papermate site, directly across Olympic Boulevard from the Arts Center, sold in 2015 for a reported price of over $500 per square foot of building area and nearly $400 per square foot of land area. The Arts Center is arguably comparable in terms of location, and if maximizing its value was an overriding priority, it could be expected to command annual rents of several million dollars per year. Given that the BBBs total passenger revenue is projected to be approximately $11 million in FY 2017/2018, generating several million dollars per year from the Arts Center site could dramatically reduce pressure on bus fares. However, because the regulations and plans for the Arts Center envision a low floor-to-area ratio and many subsidized tenants, the expected ground rent to the BBB is not expected to increase significantly.  Not including the ground lease payment, a plan without a hotel is expected to generate approximately $640,000 annually in additional City revenues, relative to current City revenues of approximately $180,000 generated by the Site. With the inclusion of a hotel, the plan is projected to generate between $1.9 million (100-room hotel) and $2.2 million (120-room hotel) annually in revenue to the Citys General Fund. The primary drivers of the increased revenues is Transient Occupancy Tax (with a hotel), supplemented by additional property taxes, and sales taxes. Attachment H provides a summary of expected municipal revenues under the three scenarios.Additional municipal revenue derived from the Bergamot Arts Center would go to the Citys General Fund, though Council could choose to allocate some or all of the increased revenue to support the BBB, given the low ground-rents that are expected to accrue to the BBB. The additional Bergamot ground rent revenue, coupled with any additional public revenues earmarked to the BBB, could help to reduce pressure on bus fares, as the BBB grapples with the cost increases that are similar to those facing the City generally (pension costs, workers compensation, health care), as well as revenue impacts related to regional and national declines in bus ridership. Understanding that the Council has consistently reinforced that revenues from the Site should be used to keep fares low for Santa Monica residents and BBB customers, and that BBB has one of the lowest transit fares in the county, additional Site revenue could help BBB reduce pressure on fare increases. As a result, the Citys choices regarding the project are expected to affect bus fares for BBB customers in the long run.   Alternatives for the SiteCouncil could consider alternative approaches to the preliminary plan. Council could direct the Worthe Group to pursue incorporation of either a 100-room, six-story hotel or a 120-room, seven-story hotel. If Council does not support a hotel use on the Site, staff requests that Council provide direction on the desired use(s) for the T building (as either gallery, nonprofit arts use, cultural; restaurant/caf or creative office) or if another use/building for the location be considered. Additional alternatives for Council consideration include retaining the existing uses, buildings, and conditions on the Site, including the surface parking and allowing the ENA with the Worthe Group to expire, though this approach would not address many of the guidelines established for the Site. Council could also direct staff to prepare a new RFP with revised project goals and directives, if the proposed preliminary plan is not deemed acceptable. The approach would delay implementation of many of the guidelines, as well as extending uncertainties as to the Citys plans for the Site, which could cause further concern to the current tenants and disruption to the on-going operations of the Arts Center.Exclusive Negotiating Agreement (ENA)The ENA between the City and the Worthe Group expires on August 31, 2017. If Council is supportive of proceeding with the revitalization of the Arts Center and continuing to partner with the Worthe Group, staff recommends Council authorize an extension to the ENA. The recommended extension is for a term of three years with two, one-year options conditioned upon the Worthe Group working in good faith to implement the revised preliminary plan selected by Council. This extension time period will allow the Worthe Group to continue their efforts to obtain the necessary land use entitlements and approvals. There is no cost to either the City or the Worthe Group in extending the ENA. Interim Property ManagementThe Master Lease Agreement with Bergamot Station Ltd. expires on December 31, 2017, at which time the existing tenants subleases and parking agreements on the Site will expire as they run concurrent with the master lease. Staff has identified four potential options for interim management or ground leasing for Council consideration.1.     If Council decides to proceed with revitalization of the Arts Center and continue to partner with the Worthe Group, then the City could enter into an interim master lease with the Worthe Group to oversee the management of the Site until land-use entitlements are in place and a long-term ground lease is executed. This approach would provide the Worthe Group with an opportunity to begin working with the Arts Center tenants in advance of any significant revitalization. 2.     The City could extend the current lease with Mr. Blank (Bergamot Station Ltd.) during the interim, which could enable continuation of some of the existing arrangements, such as parking agreements with Agensys and the owner of the privately owned portion of the Arts Center. 3.     The City could act a direct lessor, with individual leases with each tenant and overall property management responsibility. Because staff does not have capacity or expertise in providing direct property management, a property management contract would be necessary. However, such an approach is not recommended because City oversight of leasing responsibilities could have negative consequences for the Arts Center, as each lease would be subject to the competitive public procurement process. When vacancies occur, re-leasing could be significantly delayed, potentially creating extended vacancies that detract from the vitality of the Arts Center.  4.     Select a third-party, interim ground lessee who could manage the property and take responsibility for leasing. Staff does not recommend such an approach as completing the process of procuring a ground lessee, as well as executing a ground lease, could extend beyond expiration of the current ground lease and create further uncertainty among Arts Center tenants.If Council approves the extension of the ENA with the Worthe Group, staff recommends that the City enter into an interim ground lease with the Worthe Group pursuant to the following parameters:A.     The term of the interim ground lease should be three years with two, one-year options at the Citys sole discretion.A revitalization plan could be expected to undergo environmental review, obtain entitlements, and enter into a long-term ground lease with the City over a two to four-year period. The interim ground lease would spell out what occurs until construction begins. If the environmental review or entitlement period is extended beyond the three-year period, the ground lease options could be exercised.B.     During the term of the interim ground lease, sublease rents may increase by no more than the Consumer Price Index.Many Arts Center tenants continued viability is a concern if their subleases are subject to significant rent increases. The proposed parameter is designed to ensure rent stability.C.    Ground rent to the BBB would increase each year by the Consumer Price Index.The proposed parameter would ensure that ground rent for BBB keeps pace with inflation during the interim.D.    To the extent that rental income exceeds operating costs, ground rent, and a fair return to the ground lessee, excess operating income would be invested in Site improvements and building repair and restoration.Arts Center tenants and patrons have noted a variety of building and Site improvements and other infrastructure that are in need of upgrades. The proposed parameter would ensure that excess income would be invested in the Site.  Commission ActionStaff presented the preliminary plan, associated analysis, and interim site management options to the Arts Commission on April 17, 2017. Approximately 30 members of the public attended, including former members of the Bergamot Advisory Committee and Bergamot tenants. The commission had a variety of questions regarding the plan concepts and process going forward with particular concern raised about protecting the art uses at the Site. The Arts Commission met again on May 15, 2017 to develop their recommendations, with input from the Arts Commissions Bergamot Ad Hoc Committee, which is comprised of five members of the Arts Commission. Seventeen members of the public attended the meeting, including Bergamot tenants, City staff and the developers team. The Arts Commission reviewed and discussed the Bergamot Ad Hoc Committees recommendations, which formed the Commissions recommendations to Council.  The Arts Commission recommended that the ENA with the Worthe Group be extended for three years and that the Worthe Group be selected as the interim ground lessee. The Commission also recommended a variety of leasing policies for the Site during the interim management of the Arts Center. The Commission has committed to develop an arts management plan for the Arts Center with the assistance of a newly formed Arts Center management committee (Arts Management Committee) in which representatives comprised of Bergamot tenants and community representatives would be represented, following the form and guidelines established for the Public Art Committee of the Arts Commission. The Arts Management Committee would prepare a draft arts management plan within twelve months to address curation of arts programming, guidelines for tenancy selection, and preserving the art uses and architectural character of Bergamot. The Committee would report back to the Arts Commission to recommend an Arts Management Plan to Council. The Arts Commission incorporated their overall recommendations in a memo (Attachment I). In addition, the Worthe Group submitted a letter to the Arts Commission (Attachment J) in which Worthe proposes to form a non-profit organization to implement the Arts Center Management Plan. The organization would be funded by the Worthe Group annually by $270,000 with additional annual fundraising efforts. The non-profit organization would have a board comprised of representatives of the Arts Commission, the Worthe Group, and community members to advise the organizations staff who would be responsible for community programming, oversee an artist residency program and other programs, coordination of gallery openings and Arts Center events, and assisting with tenant selection.  Environmental Analysis If a preliminary plan moves forward into entitlements and ground-lease negotiations, environmental analysis pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) will be necessary. Providing conceptual direction regarding a preliminary plan is exempt from CEQA. Next Steps If Council provides direction to move forward with a preliminary plan and approves extending the ENA, the Worthe Group would prepare conceptual plans and a development agreement application, solicit additional community feedback, and provide float-up presentations to the Architectural Review Board and Planning Commission. Following the Planning Commission float-up, the project would return to the Council for conceptual approval of initial business terms regarding the lease of the property and authorization to enter into development agreement negotiations. With Council direction, staff would then prepare environmental analysis and negotiate a development agreement and a disposition and development agreement. The project would proceed in tandem with the City Yards Master Plan process in regards to negotiating the terms of the parking arrangement within a shared parking structure, and the two efforts would continue to be coordinated. ", "background": "Bergamot Station Arts Center at 2525 Michigan Avenue consists of City‑owned land and private land. The City-owned land (Site) was purchased in 1989 with transit funds with the goal of serving future transit needs in Santa Monica, including providing a source of revenue for the Big Blue Bus (BBB). It was anticipated that the Site would be reserved for future transportation-related development adjacent to a future light-rail transit stop, but the timing for development of the light-rail line and station adjacent to the Site was speculative at the time the Site was acquired and for many years thereafter.  The Site consists of approximately five acres with five buildings totaling approximately 62,000 square feet of total building space that is subleased to approximately 27 small, creative tenants, including art galleries, designers, a nonprofit theatre company, and a caf. The space was master-leased to Wayne Blank, who spearheaded its creation (along with the adjacent private land he owned) into a unique constellation of private art galleries and related arts uses, including a theater and formerly an arts museum. The City currently receives $552,553 annually in ground rent. The master lease has had relatively short terms since its initiation as the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) developed and implemented plans for light-rail service to Santa Monica along the adjacent rail right-of-way. Construction of Metros Exposition light-rail line (Expo) ultimately required a portion of the Site to be sold to Metro. The remainder of the Site remained subject to the master lease, which expires on December 31, 2017.  The Bergamot Station Arts Center complex also includes approximately 1.3 acres of privately owned adjacent land with approximately 30,000 square feet of building space that houses approximately ten galleries and other creative businesses. The private portion was owned and managed by Wayne Blank, who holds the master lease to the City-owned portion of the Arts Center. Mr. Blank sold the property in December 2016. The Site and building layout, as well as adjacent properties, are shown in Illustration 1 below.Illustration 1  Aerial Site PlanThe Bergamot Area Plan governs the privately owned and publically owned portions of the Arts Center. In 2011, in anticipation of the opening of the Expo line and a light-rail station located immediately adjacent to the Arts Center, the City began planning for the Art Centers future as part of the Bergamot Area Plan process. Council adopted the Bergamot Area Plan in 2013. It designates the Site as a Conservation Arts Center Zone with a total floor-to-area-ratio (FAR) of 1.0, or one times the parcel size as the total permitted amount of development, reflecting the lowest allowed commercial density in Santa Monica.  The Site is both highly strategic and highly sensitive for the future of both transportation and local culture  as well as the fiscal sustainability of Big Blue Bus in a time of dynamic change in transit economics. While some advocate for no changes to the current status quo, the opening of Expo, the sale of the adjacent, privately owned portion of Bergamot Station Arts Center, ongoing changes in the fine-art business, and the closing of the Santa Monica Museum of Art all point to the need to plan for the future vitality of Bergamot Station. Pursuant to Council direction, the City issued a request for qualifications for revitalization of the Site in July 2012, followed by a request for proposals (RFP) in February 2013. The RFP included eight goals for the Site, which were adopted as policy goals in the Bergamot Area Plan and further endorsed by Council on March 20, 2012 (Attachment A) for guiding Bergamots future development. The eight policy goals for the revitalization of the Site were as follows:1.     Include at least 75,000 square feet of arts-related space (equivalent to the arts-related square footage currently on-site at that time) that is affordable to nonprofit cultural arts organizations and for-profit art galleries, with emphasis on retaining existing Bergamot Station Arts Center tenants.  2.     Include open space, infrastructure, and other amenities to support public access to the light-rail station as well as improving the environment and functionality of the Site. 3.     Maximize the preservation of existing buildings, where feasible. Retaining the character of the Arts Center is very important to the community and City.  4.     Incorporate additional uses, which support the Site as a cultural destination, including evening and weekend activation, and uses that help generate revenue for the development. These uses should include a hotel, restaurant/bar, shared community meeting room/performance space and could include creative office and cultural uses that will maximize market opportunities and create a vibrant development.  5.     Consider the LUCE (Land Use Circulation Element) parking approaches and shared parking opportunities.  6.     Produce ground lease payments for the City. It is the expectation that the lease rates will be based upon fair market values taking into consideration the other development objectives.  7.     Exemplify exceptional architecture and sustainable design and construction as well as have a focused, transit-oriented development approach to design, site layout, and view corridors. 8.     Exemplify the concepts identified in the Bergamot Area Plan process.  Three proposals were submitted in response to the RFP. On September 9, 2014, Council selected the Worthe Group as the Citys development partner and authorized staff to enter into exclusive negotiations as well as directed staff to form a community advisory committee to help refine the conceptual plan for the Site (Attachment B). Council did not adopt the Worthe Groups original development proposal. The City entered into an exclusive negotiation agreement (ENA) with the Worthe Group on April 30, 2015, that is set to expire on August 30, 2017. A full record of the RFQ/RFP process and associated documents are available at the project website: www.smgov.net/Bergamot.Bergamot Station Advisory Committee and GuidelinesTo advise on future planning for the Site, on February 10, 2015, Council approved the creation of an eleven-member Bergamot Advisory Committee (Attachment C), which was composed of representatives of the Bergamot Station Gallery and Cultural Association, Santa Monica Neighborhood Council, Arts Commission, Chamber of Commerce, and Santa Monica Travel and Tourism (Attachment D). Also at the February 10, 2015 meeting, Council adopted a set of six guidelines for the revitalization of the City-owned Bergamot Station Arts Center property and defined the role of the Bergamot Advisory Committee (Advisory Committee). The guidelines were consistent with the project goals included in the RFP and vision of the Site as outlined in the Bergamot Area Plan. The six guidelines adopted by Council to direct the work of the Advisory Committee were as follows:1.     The project shall seek to minimize displacement and disruption to the fine art galleries and other creative businesses on the Site.  2.     The project shall incorporate space for additional nonprofit cultural uses.  3.     The project shall support the Expo Station and bus integration through amenities and services, including consideration of facilities such as public restrooms. 4.      The project shall incorporate a permanent home for a museum or other significant cultural institution that can demonstrate the ability to finance tenant improvements and ongoing operations while providing a cultural experience that benefits the Santa Monica community.  5.     The Site has customarily generated $622,000 of annual ground rent. The project shall maintain and increase that ground rent amount over time in order to provide a consistent revenue source for the Big Blue Bus (BBB).  6.     The project shall generate additional municipal revenues that could be used to supplement BBB funds. Bergamot Station Advisory Committee Process and RecommendationsThe Advisory Committee held its inaugural meeting on April 15, 2015, and met monthly for a year to provide recommendations regarding the preliminary plan for the revitalization of the Arts Center, working within the Council guidelines for the Site. The meetings were open to the public and conducted under Brown Act open-meeting requirements. The Housing and Economic Development Department provided staff support to the Advisory Committee and the Worthe Group attended all meetings and participated throughout the process. Meeting agendas, minutes, audio recordings, and presentations were made available on the project website: www.smgov.net/Bergamot. The Advisory Committee received presentations and diligently reviewed relevant background information on various topics such as the Bergamot Area Plan, current uses at the Arts Center, current and proposed BBB and Expo services to the Site, amenities for transit users, and the City Yards Master Plan and proposed shared-parking structure. The Advisory Committee also sought input from Wayne Blank, founder of Bergamot Station Arts Center, and invited input from individual Bergamot tenants to understand the elements that help make Bergamot special, as well as the on-going facility and operational requirements to continue to support a vibrant arts center.  Based on the review of background information, the Advisory Committee asked the Worthe Group to review and explain the mix of uses of the original proposal. The original proposal that the Worthe Group submitted in response to the Citys RFP served as a baseline for the Advisory Committees initial review, in order to understand the rationale for the mix of uses and proposed square footage attributed to each use, as well as the economics of the proposal. The Advisory Committee also reviewed and commented on key deliverables for the implementation and management of the Arts Center in order to address issues such as construction phasing, parking management, urban design, site management, infrastructure, overall Site improvements, and an arts-center management plan.  The Advisory Committee discussed and adopted formal recommendations regarding each type of use and the associated amount of building square footage, building height, and general locations on the Site. In response to the Advisory Committees feedback and recommendations, the Worthe Group revised and updated the preliminary plan, acknowledging that revitalization of the Arts Center would need to be built in phases to minimize disruption to and displacement of the existing tenants. The Advisory Committee also determined that off-site parking would need to be constructed before significant revitalization could occur. The opportunity to develop a shared parking structure at the City Yards was identified as critical to the Art Center revitalization. The Advisory Committee agreed with the need for offsite parking to replace the existing surface parking at the Site in order to create attractive, flexible open space at the Site to support art events, public art, outdoor dining, and public gathering space. The Public Works Department has incorporated the Art Centers parking need and shared parking structure concept into the City Yards master planning process. The Advisory Committee was unable to reach consensus on the inclusion of a hotel within the mix of uses at the Arts Center and a majority of Advisory Committee members (six of eleven total) ultimately voted against inclusion of a hotel in the project. In addition to its review of uses and locations, the committee evaluated the financial projections of the original proposal and revised plan. To facilitate the Advisory Committees efforts, staff produced a matrix of the Arts Center key deliverables and the Advisory Committee comments and motions made at each meeting (Attachment E). ", "summary": "The future of Bergamot Station, one of Santa Monicas most prominent arts assets, has been the subject of lengthy discussion, particularly in the context of the long-anticipated arrival of a regional light-rail station last year. With the expiration of the current master lease on December 31, 2017 and the completion of the work of the Bergamot Advisory Committee, staff seeks Council direction regarding a preliminary plan for the Arts Center advanced by the Worthe Real Estate Group development team (Worthe Group), pursuant to Councils guidelines and input from the Advisory Committee. Staff recommends extending the exclusive negotiating agreement with the Worthe Group for three years with two, one-year options to accommodate an entitlement process for development consistent with the preliminary plan for the site. During that time, an arts center management plan (as recommended by the Arts Commission) would be developed to ensure the area fully realizes its potential as a community cultural asset. Additionally, staff seeks authorization to enter into an interim, master ground lease with the Worthe Group for a period of three years with two, one-year options to commence on January 1, 2018, pursuant to parameters identified in the staff report, including that existing tenants would be offered leases with annual increases of no more than the increase in the consumer price index for up to three years. "}, "title": " Bergamot Station Arts Center", "Sponsors": null, "recommendations": ["     Provide conceptual direction regarding a preliminary plan for revitalization of the City-owned Bergamot Station Arts Center (Arts Center);", "     Authorize the City Manager to negotiate an extension of the exclusive negotiating agreement with the Worthe Group for a period of three years, with two, one-year options;", "     Authorize the City Manager to negotiate and execute an interim, master ground lease with the Worthe Group, for a period of three years, with two, one-year options, pursuant to: (a) the terms included in the staff report, including that existing tenants would face lease rate increases no greater than the consumer price index during the interim period, in order to ensure stability while future plans are developed, and (b) development of an arts center management plan in collaboration with the Arts Commission, as further discussed in the staff report.", "", "", ""], "Department": "Economic Development Division, Housing and Economic Development"}, {"Category": "08. Administrative Item", "body": {"other": "The City of Santa Monica has a healthy balance sheet with over $1.5 billion in net assets, including substantial cash reserves and well-maintained public infrastructure and consistently balanced operating budgets. All these factors contribute to the AAA bond rating from all three major credit rating agencies. However, retirement costs are a large part of the Citys annual budgets and affect long term financial sustainability. According to our most recent audited Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, total pension assets held by CalPERS were valued at $1,160,937,160 with a net unfunded liability of $386,760,127. The unfunded liability is the gap between the value of the funds members have paid into the pension fund to cover employee pensions over time, and the actual cost of the benefits in the future. The unfunded liability portion of the ARC is based on paying down the gap over a period of 30 years. Each year, the City pays the annual required contribution (ARC), as set by CalPERS. The ARC includes the cost of benefits each employee accrues each year, and an amount to pay for the unfunded liability of the plan. In recent years, changes in the assumptions used to determine plan participant demographics, the methodology used to incorporate market fluctuations into annual contributions, and low investment returns have increased the unfunded liability amount significantly. Pension costs make up approximately 7% of the Citys overall budget and 10% of the operating budget, and to a large extent are outside staffs direct control. Paying down the unfunded liability at an accelerated level leads to decreased future liabilities, and therefore results in savings in required payments now and in the future.  Investing funds in the CalPERS portfolio can also yield a higher return than staff would expect in the Citys portfolio, which is limited by restrictions mandated by State law. Council has supported this strategy by approving prior payments totaling $31.3 million to date, and adopting a policy ensuring that, if funds are available, the City will continue to make payments of at least $1 million in the General Fund and commensurate amounts in other funds annually, which translated to a total of $1.2 million in FY 2015-16. In general, staff recommends paying more than the minimum, depending on fund availability, as the ongoing savings generated from such payments provide a strong return on investment. The $45 million proposed payment will use $35 million in funds that have been set aside in the General Fund reserves as a potential supplement to future capital budgets, including City Yards modernization and contingency, as well as $8.6 million in fund balance reserves in other funds. While most funds have the necessary reserves on hand to make the pay down, staff recommends that the General Fund make forgivable loans to the Housing Authority and Pier Funds in the amounts of $200,589 and $235,458, respectively, to make the paydown, as both funds are projected to require subsidies in the next two years. Additionally, staff recommends that the General Fund would loan funds to the Rent Control Fund for its $519,669 portion of the pay down, allowing the Board the time to incorporate this additional cost into their budget.  Staff will work with the Rent Control Board to negotiate a repayment plan of this amount at a proposed annual interest rate of 1.3%, reflecting the amount earned on the Citys portfolio. Staff estimates that the $45 million payment would result in $3.8 million in on-going savings, $3 million of which would be in the General Fund. This payment would bring the total unfunded liability paydown through June 30, 2017 to $76.3 million and decrease the unfunded liability amount by an additional 11%.  In addition, in response to staffs request for an updated contribution forecast, CalPERS applied new information that reflects slightly better performance in the Citys experience level and market returns to the Citys plan. The updated information has allowed CalPERS to lower the pre-paydown contribution amounts by up to $4 million annually citywide beginning in FY 2018-19.  Barring any other changes, the combination of these two changes would decrease the General Fund deficit in FY 2021-22 by $6 million. Upon receiving the payment, CalPERS will recalculate the Citys required payment for the following fiscal year, based on the associated lower liability. For the FY 2017-18 fiscal year, CalPERS has set a June 20, 2017 deadline to receive the payment and recalculate FY 2017-18 employer contribution requirements. This means that staff must submit the payment prior to this date to realize savings in FY 2017-18. Staff therefore recommends that Council approve the release of reserved funds and budget appropriation. The FY 2016-17 Revised Budget includes an appropriation of $1,263,844 for the annual PERS paydown payment. The Rent Control Budget includes a $15,737 appropriation for the paydown.  An additional $43,720,419 appropriation is necessary to make the $45,000,000 payment to CalPERS.

The Citys fiscal policies establish annual payments above the annual required contribution to CalPERS that accelerate the paying down of the Citys unfunded pension liability. The payments are for a minimum of $1 million in the General Fund and a commensurate amount in all other funds. The policy also provides for additional payments if funds are available.

Consent Calendar", "body": {"other": "The Risk Management Division of the Finance Department is responsible for managing the Citys Workers Compensation Program.  In this capacity, the Department has relied on in-house personnel to administer workers compensation claims since 2001. The decision to use internal or external staff to administer claims is unique to each employer. In 2001, the City selected an internal management model in hopes of improving program outcomes through direct control over claims administration.  Over the past two decades, however, TPAs have made advancements in the quality, sophistication, and breadth of services offered to their clients. TPAs also have a variety of advantages over an in-house program like the Citys. A few key examples include:          TPAs can provide their employees with incentives for consistently exceeding performance targets. Public sector compensation plans are not set up to contemplate incentive plans of this nature.          Due to size, TPAs have systems in place to automatically redeploy examiner staff when the accounts assigned examiner is out of the office (e.g., vacation, medical/family leaves, etc.). This ensures that claims continue to move forward when the assigned examiner is unavailable. The Citys program is too small to provide this type of back-up.          TPAs have more resources available to support claims staff and improve outcomes. An established TPA can provide everything from proprietary risk management information systems (RMIS) that offer unique capabilities (e.g., employees can track claim status and medical appointments on smart phones, etc.) to in-house training units devoted to keeping claims staff up-to-date on the latest developments/best practices in the workers compensation arena.          TPAs are able to spread their fixed administrative costs (e.g., administrative staff, training, RMIS, office rents, etc.) across all of their clients. Collectively, these advancements and advantages have positioned TPAs to provide very cost-effective claims administration services. This information was presented to the Working Group and prompted their subsequent support for pursuing a pilot program to determine whether the City could benefit from using a TPA to manage its workers compensation claims. Pilot Program ProposalThe Working Group selected BBB to serve as the test group for the pilot program. BBB represents a little over one-quarter of the Citys workers compensation open claim inventory and generates roughly 90 to 100 new claims per year. Further, it receives claims from a cross-section of workers that mirrors the Citys total inventory of claims (i.e., claims from workers performing sedentary jobs and physically demanding jobs). These characteristics, coupled with the BBBs keen desire to be more involved in managing its workers compensation claims, make it the ideal test group in the City for the pilot program. Once BBB was selected for the pilot, a group of staff from BBB, Finance/Risk Management, and Human Resources was assembled to develop and issue an RFP for claims administration services.  The group also established the following parameters for pursuing the pilot program:          Implementation: The TPA will manage all of BBBs existing workers compensation claims and any new claims received during the pilot period. BBB staff, in turn, will serve as the TPAs primary contact throughout the pilot program. BBB already handles certain human resources-oriented tasks with internal staff, and as such, is uniquely positioned to effectively oversee the efforts of a TPA. The balance of the Citys claims will continue to be managed by the Citys in-house staff in Risk Management. Efforts of the in-house staff previously devoted to BBB will be redeployed to the remaining claim inventory. This will bring down internal staff caseloads to approximately 110 claims per examiner, which is equivalent to the TPA examiner caseload requirements set out in the RFP and considered an industry best practice.          Ongoing Oversight: BBB, Finance/Risk Management, and Human Resources will work together to closely monitor the TPAs performance during the pilot period to ensure that any issues with TPA performance are detected and addressed in a timely manner.          Employee Notification: Injured employees with open workers compensation claims will be provided ample notice of the changeover so all questions/concerns can be addressed and all medical services and benefit payments continue without interruption.          Accounting Arrangements: The BBBs share of the Workers Compensation Self-Insurance Funds (Fund 59) assets and liabilities will be calculated and transferred to a newly created fund so that pilot program financial performance can be accurately tracked. Once these figures are available, staff will return to Council for authorization to create a Transit Workers Compensation Self-Insurance Fund and transfer the assets/liabilities.          Program Evaluation: BBB and Finance/Risk Management will evaluate the pilot programs success against a set of objective performance measures  (e.g., total cost per claim, lost-time per claim, total open claim inventory, overhead costs per claim, etc.) and subjective performance measures (e.g., employee satisfaction surveys, employee focus groups, etc.) throughout the pilot period and at its conclusion. BBB and Risk Management will be responsible for reporting out at regular intervals to the Working Group on the pilot programs performance. At the conclusion of the three-year pilot period, the Working Group will make a recommendation to the City Council as to whether the TPA contract should be terminated, extended for BBB only (thus the inclusion of the two, one-year renewal options), or possibly expanded to include a larger segment of the Citys workers compensation claims. TPA Selection ResultsOn March 7, 2017, the City published an RFP for workers compensation claims administration services for the BBB.  The RFP was posted on the Citys online bidding site and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provisions. 373 potential firms were notified of the RFP and 31 downloaded the bid. The following seven firms submitted a response: AdminSure Inc.; Athens Administrators; Broadspire Services Inc.; CorVel Corporation; Intercare Holdings Insurance Services, Inc.; Tristar Risk Management; and York Risk Management Services. An evaluation panel comprised of staff from BBB, Finance/Risk Management, and Human Resources evaluated all seven RFP responses based on the criteria in SMMC 2.24.073, including price, staffing commitment, understanding of program goals and objectives, references/experience, incentive plan commitment, and value-added services. The panel used the criteria to narrow the field to four firms who were invited to make on-site presentations. The interviews confirmed all four of the firms were capable of competently fulfilling the RFPs scope of work and offered competitive pricing and value-added services. On balance, however, Intercare Holdings Insurance Services offered the best combination of staffing, transit claim experience, references, and price.  Therefore, staff recommends Intercare Holdings Insurance Services as the best-qualified firm to provide the claims administration services requested in the RFP. Contracted Services PolicyWhile the Citys Contracted Services Policy contemplates physical or manual work as opposed to professional services, the intent of the policy, coupled with its evaluation criteria, provided staff with guidance for assessing the appropriateness of pursuing the pilot program. Specifically, the proposal contained in this staff report meets the spirit of at least five of the criteria set out in the policy: 1) it is a pilot program; 2) the City would benefit cost-wise from the contractors economies of scale; 3) the contractor is better positioned to respond to workload fluctuations; 4) the contractor is equipped with back-up staffing options; and 5) the contractors performance can be measured through objective means. In light of this, staff determined that pursuit of the pilot program was consistent with the Councils policy for contracting out services. TCS Contract The City currently has an agreement in place with TCS Risk Management Services, LLC for workers compensation consulting services.  The contract was awarded to TCS by the City Council at its December 2015 meeting (attachment A) after engaging in a competitive selection process. TCS provides Risk Management with indepth quarterly analyses on the financial and operational performance of the Workers Compensation Program. Staff is requesting to amend TCSs agreement to include assistance with developing the pilot programs performance measures, transitioning claims administration services to the TPA, and monitoring pilot program performance.

In FY 2017-18 alone, the Citys contributions to the Workers Compensation Self-Insurance Fund increased by 50%. Further, contributions are projected to rise by 10% annually thereafter if current claims trends continue. In response to this, the Finance Director convened a Workers Compensation Working Group composed of the Assistant City Manager, City Attorney, Human Resources Director, and Risk Manager for the purpose of promoting initiatives to curb the Citys growing workers compensation costs. Under the guidance of the Working Group, a variety of pilot cost control projects have been put in place across the City. Examples include the Wow, Thats Fast Program, which provides comprehensive case management services to injured sworn personnel and post-job-offer functional capacity testing to ensure prospective employees are capable of safely carrying out essential job functions prior to placement. The most recent idea to emerge from the Working Group involves a BBB/Risk Management Division proposal to contract with a TPA to manage the BBBs workers compensation claims. The idea was intriguing to the Working Group due to the many advantages a reputable and established TPA could have over an in-house program, and it resulted in the development of a three-year pilot program proposal to determine which model is more cost-effective. The details of the pilot program proposal follow. ", "summary": "The Finance Department and Big Blue Bus (BBB) are requesting to engage in a three-year pilot program to determine the most cost-effective model for managing workers compensation claims.

Pilot program performance will be evaluated and monitored by BBB and Finance throughout the pilot period.  In order to pursue the pilot program, staff from the Finance, BBB and Human Resources Departments solicited formal proposals from TPAs for workers compensation claims administration services. Based on this process, staff recommends that the City enter into an agreement with Intercare Holdings Insurance Services, Inc. for an amount not to exceed $1,699,509 over a five-year period. In addition, staff recommends that the City amend its existing contract with TCS Risk Management Services, the Citys workers compensation consultant, for assistance with transitioning claims administration services to the TPA and tracking and monitoring the pilot programs performance.

Consent Calendar", "body": {"other": "SCE Charge Ready ProgramDeploying public infrastructure for EV charging can be a complicated and expensive process. Existing electrical and site infrastructure in public locations throughout the city are often inadequate to support additional electrical demand from EV charging. Design, engineering and construction that includes electrical infrastructure upgrades necessary to facilitate the installation of EV chargers typically cost two to five times the cost of the charger itself, which often makes the installation of EV chargers impractical.  To help alleviate this issue, Southern California Edison (SCE) developed a pilot program called Charge Ready. Charge Ready offers site hosts the opportunity to receive free electrical infrastructure  including design, permitting and construction  to support a minimum of 10 charging spaces per installation location and a rebate for the purchase cost of the EV chargers. The site host is responsible for the purchase and installation of the EV chargers once the electrical infrastructure has been installed.  In order to qualify for the SCE Charge Ready program, the site host must purchase and install smart EV chargers that comply with SCEs requirements and agree to SCEs program terms. SCE released a Request for Information (RFI) with technological requirements, including usage data management and utility communications capabilities for EV chargers, and pre-qualified 13 vendors from which the City can choose. The terms of the program include an easement for the electrical equipment and participation in SCEs future demand response events, which could throttle back charging when the need and cost of energy is high. This would reduce the rate of charge by a nominal amount; however, if aggregated across a number of chargers, the reduction in electrical demand can be significant. As a best management practice, fleet vehicles will be directed to charge mostly in the afternoon or evening, when the cost and demand for electricity is low. In November 2016, staff applied to receive support through SCEs Charge Ready application portal and identified two sites for City fleet charging and public charging for a total of 55 charging ports, as detailed below in Table 1. These sites were determined to be the most feasible after considering parking capacity, ADA access, and anticipated charging demand at a variety of potential locations.  Table 1. SCE Charge Ready InstallationsBeach Lot 5 SouthResident, Visitor11224 (2 ADA accessible)Civic Center Parking Structure (roof)City Fleet15131 26 Under the Charge Ready program, SCE would design, engineer and construct the electrical infrastructure necessary to provide EV charging at the proposed sites at no cost to the site host (the City). The infrastructure involved would be electrical cabinets with transformers, and electrical panels and an electrical conduit that connects the cabinet to the EV charging spaces. SCE will manage the entire construction process and coordinate with City staff as needed. Based on SCEs $12,000 per charging port project budget, the total estimated in-kind value of the design and construction costs of these projects is over $600,000. An additional benefit of the program is the significant reduction of project delivery time. Once the City purchases the equipment for the Charge Ready sites, it will receive a 25% rebate against the purchase of the equipment from SCE. SCE has prequalified eligible equipment, their base cost and the maximum rebate amount. This amount is estimated at $22,151 (Table 3) and is expected to be received in FY 2017-18. This rebate will be deposited into the Citys Energy Revolving Loan Fund.  Table 2.

As a requirement of participation in SCEs Charge Ready program, the City must select an SCE pre-qualified vendor to install chargers at its two selected sites. On May 19, 2017, the City issued a Request for Proposals directed at the pre-qualified vendors to furnish, deliver and install smart electric vehicle service equipment (EVSE, or EV chargers) for replacing its existing chargers and installing new chargers at the Charge Ready sites, and for ongoing management services, such as networking and maintenance, in accordance with City specifications. The RFP was posted on the Citys on-line bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provisions. 10 proposals were received and publicly opened on June 14, 2017. Of the 10 proposers, 6 were invited to present and participate in interviews. Staff from the Parking Division, Information Systems Department, Street & Fleet Division and Office of Sustainability & the Environment evaluated the proposals and conducted interviews.

ChargePoint was selected based on its experience, strength of existing network and user base, integrated product and services, and value of services.          Experience  ChargePoint has 10 years of experience and is a large and well established company that is financially stable and can be expected to operate and maintain its EV charging equipment well into the future. ChargePoint also has the most experience in managing Low Carb Fuel Standard credits, a requirement of this RFP.         Strength of existing network and user base  ChargePoint has one of the strongest and most prolific networks of charging stations and EV drivers in California and the United States. This is important for frequent users who drive in and out of Santa Monica and are able to access the ChargePoint network. This idea is similar to the use of Social Bicycles  which operates Santa Monicas bikeshare system  in other cities within a regional bike sharing area so that system continuity can be established across city boundaries. Currently, EV drivers must carry multiple radio frequency identification (RFID) cards and maintain multiple accounts to access varying brands of EV chargers within a single area. Most new EV drivers are given a ChargePoint access card when they purchase or lease a new vehicle and have familiarity with its system.         Integrated product and services  Of the companies evaluated, ChargePoint is one of two providers that manufactures and operates its own equipment and provides site host services. The other company, Tellus Power, did not have as robust of a software program or customer service presence. Most other companies either specialize in only manufacturing hardware or only providing software as a service. This provides value in that there would be one entity, ChargePoint, responsible for the entire supply chain and operation that is involved in providing EV charging equipment and services.         Value of services  ChargePoint offers comprehensive turnkey services from procurement and installation to on-boarding, network and user customization and maintenance services. Rather than one hardware firm and one software firm coordinating services, ChargePoint provides a seamless experience that would enable staff to minimize downtime and management burden. ChargePoints charging equipment and web-based solutions also provide a high level of performance, customization, management capabilities and polished aesthetic that is required. Its management software was judged by the review committee to be superior to all of the other bidders. The software would enable staff to customize operating hours, user group access settings, monitor activity and outages, and provide real-time updates and reports.          Warranty  ChargePoint offers a free one-year warranty that is superior to the other vendors in that it covers vandalism and accidental damage to its EV charging equipment in addition to defects in materials or workmanship. ChargePoint would provide EV chargers for the Citys 29 new stations (55 ports) at the Charge Ready sites. ChargePoint would also provide services for installation, construction management, networking, charging for public and City fleet vehicles, revenue generation, Low Carbon Fuel Standard credit management, maintenance and repair. After the first-year capital cost of $229,077 for the purchase and installation of the chargers, the annual operating costs are estimated not to exceed $13,075 per year for four years. This brings the total not to exceed agreement amount to $281,377 over a five-year period.

This total includes 7 dual-port chargers at the Civic Center Structure that were provided by UCLA through a grant-funded research project. Nine charging stations at City Yards are used exclusively for the Citys vehicle fleet, which now includes over 130 electric vehicles. With the advent of the Chevy Bolt and Tesla Model 3, EVs will continue to increase. Additionally, increasing EV charging will be essential for the Citys carbon neutrality goals. Staff will return to Council with an EV Action Plan in fall 2017.

This report also provides responses to the three issues that Council requested additional information. Incentivizing Affordable LodgingStaff recommends adding a new policy (CCP2.3) to encourage overnight accommodations and a new action (CCP2.3A) to explore regulatory incentives for affordable overnight accommodations.  NEW Policy CCP2.3: Support Downtowns role as a visitor destination by encouraging uses that appeal to both locals and tourists, including food, retail, entertainment and overnight accommodations.NEW Action CCP2.3A Evaluate regulatory incentives to establish a broader base of affordable overnight accommodations Downtown.Lead Agency: PCD, HEDTimeframe: Mid-Term Boys and Girls Club Administrative Approval RequestDuring the July 10, 2017 public hearing, public comments were made by a representative of the Boys and Girls Club raising questions as to whether the Boys and Girls Club is a permitted use, waiver of fees, and whether consideration for increasing the size thresholds to 35,000 square feet for Administrative Approval could be given for non-profit, youth-serving facilities. Council gave direction to bring back information on addressing the issues raised by the commenter.  The Boys and Girls Club fits within the community assembly use classification in the Zoning Ordinance and is a permitted use in the Lincoln Transition district. Staff does not believe that the DCP is the appropriate vehicle for waiver of development fees and would recommend deferring this to Councils review of the comprehensive fee schedules.  Regarding the review process thresholds for commercial projects, the DCP has higher Administrative Approval (AA) thresholds for housing projects (75,000 sf) and exempts 100% affordable housing from a Development Review Permit. The Zoning Ordinance also already includes an increased AA threshold of 25,000 sf for any auto dealer facility replacing an existing legally-established auto dealer facility or expansion of any existing auto dealer facility within Tier 1 limits. The Boys and Girls Club is currently located on a 37,500 sf parcel. There is an additional 7,500 sf parcel to the north that is also owned by the Boys and Girls Club and is currently occupied by administrative offices and housing. There is a significant difference in process for 35,000 sf buildings between the review thresholds that Council has endorsed (development agreement) and the proposal by the Boys and Girls Club (Administrative Approval). The increased AA thresholds for housing projects and auto dealers was based on the desire to incentivize the land use and an understanding of the scale and type of building that may result. Since non-profit, youth-serving community assembly uses are not common, the size, massing, and placement of a future is somewhat unknown. A Development Review Permit would provide opportunity to shape a potentially larger project.  Therefore, staff recommends that the AA threshold be set at 25,000 sf and a Development Review Permit be required for a project larger than 25,000 square feet, which would be similar to the benefit afforded auto dealers and balance incentives for non-profit, youth-serving facilities with public review. The following provides a comparison of the Council-endorsed thresholds, the Boys and Girls Club proposal, and Staffs recommendation. Administrative ApprovalUp to 10,000 sfUp to 35,000 sfUp to 25,000 sfDevelopment Review Permit10,000-30,000 sfGreater than 35,000 sfGreater than 25,000 sfDevelopment AgreementGreater than 30,000 sfN/AN/A In order to address the process issue, staff recommends the following language be added to Section 9.10.050 (DCP Page 180): Notwithstanding Section 9.10.050, a Development Review Permit shall be required for any new non-profit youth-serving community assembly facility replacing an existing legally-established non-profit, youth-serving community assembly facility or expansion of an existing facility if such replacement building or expansion exceeds 25,000 square feet within Tier 1 limits and is located on land occupied by the non-profit youth-serving community assembly use as of July 25, 2017 Further, to provide the Boys and Girls Club with the policy support to renovate their facilities, the following new policy and associated action is recommended to be added to the Community, Culture and Prosperity chapter (Chapter 2B): NEW Policy CCP2.4 Support the expansion and enhancement of community and social services that contribute to the wellbeing of residents, including youth and families, seniors, persons with disabilities, individuals experiencing homelessness and members of our most vulnerable populations.NEW Action CCP2.4A Collaborate with the Santa Monica Boys and Girls Club to identify and resolve obstacles to the renovation of their facilities on Lincoln Boulevard.Lead Agencies: CCS, PCDTimeframe: Mid-Term 201 WilshireThe property owner and representatives for the parcel at 201 Wilshire Boulevard spoke at the July 10, 2017 public hearing and requested that the City Council increase the height and FAR for the parcel because it does not abut residential uses. The commenters requested that height and FAR be increased to 60 feet and 3.5 FAR to match the Bayside Conservation District. The property is located within the Wilshire Transition district, which is intended to support the smaller, local-serving uses that provide easily accessible goods and services to the surrounding neighborhood and also to provide opportunity for housing above the ground floor of new development. The proposed scale for the District is established to be complementary to its urban context in the Downtown and provide new buildings that are consistent with the scale of nearby residential uses. The Wilshire Transition district has a maximum allowable height of 40 and 1.75 FAR for commercial projects and 50 and 2.25 FAR for housing projects. Further, the EIR studied the north side of Wilshire as a transition zone with a maximum height of 50 and 2.25 FAR. After some discussion, Council directed staff to bring back more information and options to address the issues raised by the commenter. 201 Wilshire is a commercially designated parcel at the corner of Wilshire and 2nd Street. It is adjacent to other commercially designated parcels within the Wilshire Transition District. It is not directly adjacent to residential parcels, but within close proximity. Staff has further analyzed the request to increase height and FAR for 201 Wilshire Boulevard and found that the parcel is somewhat unique if the three following factors are considered:          Frontage on Wilshire Boulevard         Lack of adjacency to residentially-zoned parcels         Designated as Downtown Core in the LUCE The only other parcel that shares the same characteristics is the Miramar parcel, which has a pending development agreement application and is covered by the Established Large Site Overlay.  Comparison of Development StandardsBC (Promenade)BC (2nd and 4th Streets)Wilshire Transition (Housing)201 Wilshire ProposalTier 11.751.751.5 Tier 1  With Housing2.252.251.5Tier 22.753.01.75Tier 2  With Housing2.753.52.253.5100% Affordable3.254.02.754.0 BC (Promenade)BC (2nd and 4th Streets)Wilshire Transition(Housing)201 Wilshire ProposalTier 1323232 Tier 1  With Housing393939Tier 2606040Tier 2  With Housing60605060100% Affordable70706070 Alternatives for Council ConsiderationIf Council would like to consider increasing height and FAR that has narrow applicability, the following language could be added to Section 9.10.060:For parcels in the Wilshire Transition District that (a) front on Wilshire Boulevard, (b) are not adjacent a residentially-zoned parcel, and (c) are designated Downtown Core under the LUCE, the Tier 2 maximum height and FAR for housing projects shall be 60 feet and 2.75 FAR. This language would apply only to one other property (Miramar) and would ensure that the increased height is only for housing projects. This approach is consistent with Councils direction to provide process incentives for housing compared to commercial development. This language may best accomplish both the property owners objectives for flexibility in land use and Councils objectives to incentivize housing while also maintaining balance with the remainder of the Wilshire Transition district. Alternatively, if Council would like to consider increasing height and FAR for both commercial and residential projects, staff would recommend that height and FAR for commercial projects be 50 and 2.25 FAR and housing projects be 60 and 2.75 FAR. Staff requested that HR&A prepare updated feasibility analyses that tested Councils endorsement of both on-site and off-site affordable housing requirements for Tier 2 and qualifying Tier 3 housing projects. The analysis includes:      the DCPs affordability mix from extremely low income to moderate income levels;      an 84-foot, 4.0 FAR variation of the 72-foot, 40. FAR prototype that was previously tested; and      increased off-site affordable housing requirements per Councils direction on July 11, 2017. On-Site Affordable HousingAs stated during the public hearing by HR&A, the on-site affordable housing percentages endorsed by Council on July 11, 2017 are technically financially feasible, but of the prototypes tested, nearly all produce marginal returns. 502.2220%MarginalMarginal602.7525%FeasibleMarginal724.030%FeasibleFeasible844.030%FeasibleMarginal There are many different conditions of property ownership within the Downtown area and as noted previously by HR&A, this analysis includes assumptions to account for typical market conditions and therefore, is not intended to account for every possible scenario. The analysis may be read to measure the likelihood that developers will proceed with proposing housing projects that have on-site affordable housing units. The results suggest that these prototypes are particularly sensitive to shifts in market conditions where affordable housing hampers feasibility, which may result in a scenario where housing development is discouraged altogether.  Off-Site Affordable HousingThe off-site housing percentages were also tested and HR&A found that the 50- and 60-foot prototypes are not financially feasible with only the 84-foot prototype producing marginal feasibility.502.2225%Not FeasibleNot Feasible602.7530%Not FeasibleNot Feasible844.035%MarginalMarginal HR&A indicates that the 50- and 60-foot prototypes under off-site requirements that are two to three percentage points above the Council-endorsed on-site requirement (i.e. 22-23 or 27-28%, respectively) would be more likely to be feasible. However, if the intent is to not allow an off-site option, it may be prudent to eliminate the option entirely. Staff has made changes to the Zoning Ordinance to reflect Councils direction to eliminate parking minimums in the Downtown and keep the proposed parking maximums. There are several standards that rely on required parking and staff has attempted to address all of these changes. However, as with the Zoning Ordinance Update, it is likely that staff will need to return in a few months with further changes in order to implement this new policy direction for Downtown. This may include clarifications of language, revisiting fees, mobility requirements, and procedures on how existing parking is shared.  Council endorsed the following review process thresholds for housing projects which allowed Tier 2 and Tier 3 housing projects up to 75,000 square feet to be approved by Administrative Approval. Tier 2 housing projects greater than 75,000 square feet are reviewed by Development Review Permit. However, Tier 3 housing projects greater than 75,000 square feet are reviewed by Development Agreement. The Planning Commissions original proposal to allow for projects on lots between 15,000 and 22,500 square feet (effectively projects between 60,000 to 90,000 square feet) to be reviewed by Development Review Permit. In making the change for streamlining to 75,000 square feet, staff had inadvertently left out a possible Development Review Permit option for Tier 3 housing projects between 75,000 and 90,000 square feet. If Council intended to maintain three possible avenues for entitlement for Tier 3 projects, the following table demonstrates the appropriate review thresholds: Administrative ApprovalProjects up to 75,000 sfDevelopment Review PermitTier 2 over 75,000 sfTier 3: 75,000  90,000 sfDevelopment AgreementTier 3 greater than 90,000 sf Staff and Planning Commission gave serious consideration to both the Final EIR (FEIR) and the public commentary lodged at every stage of the discussion, including the final Public Hearing before the City Council. As identified in the Final EIR, the DCP would have very few significant impacts due to the self-mitigating nature of the plan, integration of land use and transportation to reduce vehicle trips, and emphasis on sustainability. However, in the limited cases where potentially significant impacts have been identified a Mitigation Monitoring Plan and Statement of Overriding Considerations have been developed and necessary CEQA findings are summarized in a separate resolution. In addition, a memorandum is provided (ATTACHMENT A) that evaluates recommended changes to the Draft DCP since completion of the FEIR and concludes that no additional environmental analysis is needed to ensure that all potential impacts of the proposed DCP are addressed in compliance with CEQA.  Downtown is both the shared living room for all Santa Monica residents and the primary economic engine of the local economy. The DCP takes into consideration the diverse viewpoints that encompass our communitys vision for Downtowns future, based on a far-reaching and inclusive process that engaged thousands of residents. This six-year effort included public workshops, discussions, presentations, surveys, and public hearings. The Final DCP will incorporate all of the modifications formally adopted by the City Council as part of the final DCP adoption resolution. Following Councils adoption of the Plan, a final DCP document will be prepared to incorporate the modifications, which will serve as an enduring long-term framework for preserving and enhancing the unique character and vitality of Downtown Santa Monica. ", "summary": " After six years of community discussion, the City Council held a public hearing on July 10 and July 11 to review, discuss, and provide final direction to staff on changes to the DCP for ratification on July 25, 2017.

Those hearings generally cover appeals of City-issued administrative citations and appeals of City decisions/orders relating to licensing and permitting. During the course of managing and undertaking administrative hearings over the past several years, staff has gained valuable experience about the process. Staff now brings this proposed Ordinance to make minor procedural enhancements to hearings, provide clarification and align local law with longstanding practices.", "other": "Background The Santa Monica Municipal Code sets forth the procedures for appeals of administrative citations or decisions. Generally, Chapter 1.09 governs appeals of administrative citations, and Chapter 6.16 governs appeals of orders that consist of denial, suspension, or revocation of permits or licenses. The proposed changes to Chapters 1.09 and 6.16 of the SMMC would recognize and codify existing practices, provide consistency to the existing framework of administrative citation appeals procedures, and give flexibility to City staff responsible for scheduling the hearings. The proposed changes would also add necessary or clarifying language, and delete extraneous and/or confusing language from relevant sections of the SMMC. The proposed change to Section 8.08.040 would codify the current practice of limiting appeals of building and work permits or orders to persons who are directly involved in the permitting process, including the permit applicant, owner of the property, and/or recipient of the order. The change would minimize confusion by the public, and provide guidance to City staff when processing appeal requests by parties who are not authorized to file or when eligible parties file competing requests.The proposed change to Section 10.04.04.040(e) is intended to correct the reference to an ill-fitting chapter for appeals in the Aircraft Noise Abatement Code, bring the Aircraft Noise Abatement Code appeals process in conformity with other City department's enforcement practices, and provide consistency within the administrative citation appeals framework of the SMMC.Discussion Amendments to Section 1.09.090 of SMMCSanta Monica Municipal Code Chapter 1.09 authorizes the issuance of administrative citations; Section 1.09.090 of the SMMC specifically addresses the hearing procedures for the appeal of an administrative citation brought by the recipient of the citation. The proposed changes would provide City staff with greater flexibility when scheduling the hearings to meet deadlines; recognize Hearing Officers inherent power to maintain order during hearings; and recognize the City Attorneys Offices discretion to resolve disputes even after the hearings have been conducted. The proposed changes include the following:         Amend Section 1.09.090(b) of the SMMC to extend the deadline for scheduling an appeals hearing from thirty to sixty days from the date the hearing request is filed with the City. The City Attorney's Office staff coordinates the hearings and experience has shown that thirty days can sometimes be inadequate, as staff needs to schedule a time that works for the party seeking the hearing, the City's enforcement officer who issued the citation, as well as the Hearing Officer. Scheduling conflicts and requests for changes are not uncommon, and can delay the process and inadvertently cause time limits established by the SMMC to be exceeded. Accordingly, the proposed amendment would provide staff with greater flexibility to schedule a hearing in time to meet the deadline. Additionally, changing the period to sixty days would align this deadline with SMMC Section 6.16.030(d), which requires a hearing contesting the denial/suspension/revocation of a City permit or license to be not later than sixty days following receipt of the request by the City Clerk.         The words \"City Official or the City Attorney\" would be replaced by \"Hearing Officer\" as the decision-maker of whether there is good cause to extend the scheduling of the hearing beyond the sixty-day time limit. This proposed change would provide consistency with SMMC Section 1.09.090(g), which states the Hearing Officer may continue the hearing upon a showing of good cause.         New subsection \"h\" would insert the language \"The Hearing Officer shall have the power to issue orders to keep order and decorum during an Administrative Hearing. No person shall fail to comply with any such order.\" This language codifies what is already well recognized to be one aspect of the inherent powers of the Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer is charged with \"conducting the review\" under SMMC Section 1.09.080.          And finally, new subsection (i) would insert the word \"after\" to clarify that the City Attorney's Office has discretion to reach a plea agreement, settle, or dismiss the citation after the hearing has been conducted. The amendment would codify the tradition and well-recognized prosecutorial discretion of the City Attorney's Office to reach a settlement of the dispute before, during, or after the hearing has been conducted.Amendments to Section 6.16.030 of SMMCChapter 6.16 of the SMMC governs appeals of persons contesting \"the action of any officer or employee of the City suspending, revoking, or denying any permit or license.\" The proposed amendments to this Chapter are intended to clarify and recognize existing practices and provide consistency with other provisions of the SMMC.          Amend Section 6.16.030(b) to insert the word \"grant\" to clarify the Hearing Officer's existing powers. This section, as amended, would also insert the following language: \"The Appellant has the burden of proving, based on the preponderance of the evidence, that the City's action is not in compliance with applicable laws.\" The insertion would recognize the basic rule of law that the party seeking an appeal of a decision carries the burden of proof. This amendment would also maintain consistency with the burden of proof requirement for civil actions.         And finally, the proposed insertion of the language at Section 6.16.030(d) empowering the Hearing Examiner to maintain order during a hearing, is already addressed above.Amendment to Section 8.08.040 of SMMCChapter 8.08 of the SMMC provides for an appeals process for parties seeking to challenge any decisions, orders, or determinations issued by the Building Officer or the Fire Marshal, including stop work, suspension or revocation orders. Consistent with longstanding City practice, such appeals can only be sought by the permit applicant, the property owner of any permit at issue, or the recipient of any order from the Building Officer or the Fire Marshal. The proposed amendment makes this practice explicit. Furthermore, the proposed amendment would also clarify that when there are multiple parties with the right to appeal, the property owner's decision to appeal shall control. Codification and clarification of this longstanding practice would serve to minimize confusion by the public, and be helpful to City staff.Amendment to Section 10.04.040 of SMMCThe Aircraft Noise Abatement Code (Section 10.04.04) of the SMMC provides for an appeal process of an order by the Airport Director. The Aircraft Noise Abatement Code empowers the Airport Director to impose civil and administrative remedies for violations of the Aircraft Noise Abatement Code, including monetary fines and suspension or revocation of Airport privileges or permits. Currently Section 10.04.04.040(e) of the SMMC provides, in part, that persons aggrieved by an order of the Airport Director may appeal to the City's Hearing Examiner pursuant to the time limits and procedures of Chapter 6.16 of this Code.\" However, this reference to Chapter 6.16 is inconsistent with the other parts of the SMMC because most of the orders issued by the Airport Director under the Aircraft Noise Abatement Code consist of monetary fines and Chapter 6.16 sets forth processes for appealing the denial or revocation of permits, not monetary fines. The procedures set forth in Chapter 1.09 of the SMMC are more appropriate for appealing monetary fines. As to the appeals of orders of the Airport Director that include suspending or revoking Airport privileges or permits, the appeal procedure would reference Chapter 6.16.Financial Impacts and Budget Actions There is no immediate financial impact or budget action necessary as a result of the recommended action.

Administrative Item", "body": {"": "Executive Summary Of the City Councils five Strategic Goals, maintaining an inclusive and diverse community focuses directly on addressing the strains on individuals and families to afford to live in Santa Monica. The Citys Housing Trust Funds Guidelines (Guidelines) establish the requirements and procedures for the approval of funding for affordable housing. During the past year, the Housing Commission undertook a comprehensive review of the Guidelines, which culminated in a set of recommendations presented in this report. The proposed revisions to the Guidelines include the creation of a new housing trust fund, expanded planning and reporting procedures, protocols to refine loan approval rationale, and enhanced transparency regarding the use of all housing trust funds. ", "other": "A three-member subcommittee of Housing Commissioners reviewed the Guidelines and presented a draft report (Attachment D) with recommendations to the Housing Commission on May 18, 2017. The subcommittee report recommended the following to City Council: (1) Creation of a new Redevelopment Replacement Housing Trust Fund; (2) Public planning and reporting on all Housing Trust Funds; (3) Increased transparency regarding approved loans, trust fund balances, and uses of funds; and (4) Limited changes to the loan-approval process. The Commission discussed the draft report, approved minor revisions, and adopted the final report (Attachment E). Each section below includes the Housing Commissions recommendations to City Council, followed by staffs identification of any legal or administrative issues associated with the proposed revisions to the Guidelines. Creation of a New Housing Trust FundCurrently, the scope of the Guidelines includes five existing housing trust funds, as follows:(1)  Citywide Housing Trust Fund(2)  Redevelopment Housing Trust Fund(3)  HOME Housing Trust Fund(4)  CDBG Housing Trust Fund(5)  TORCA Housing Trust Fund The Housing Commission recommends the creation of a new, sixth housing trust fund called Redevelopment Replacement Housing Trust Fund (RRHTF) containing revenue from 50% of the Measure GSH transaction and use tax and General Funds allocated annually by Council, initially derived from the former Redevelopment Agency (RDA) loan repayments. Establishing a new and separate housing trust fund is intended to provide transparency regarding tracking, expenditure, and use of the funds delineated through a reserve account in the Special Revenue Source Fund. General Funds include dedicated funds from the June 14, 2016 City Council meeting in which City Council directed staff to set aside the RDA loan repayments for affordable housing (Attachment F). The Housing Commission also recommends specific requirements and eligible uses to ensure funds meet the Citys priority affordable housing needs. The Housing Commission recommends a three-pronged approach for the RRHTF that seeks to 1) increase affordable housing opportunities with new construction, 2) preserve existing affordable housing with acquisition and rehabilitation, and 3) prevent displacement of low-income households with rental-subsidy programs. One key recommendation is targeting the funding to households with incomes at or below 80 percent of area median income. Another recommendation is that proposed eligible uses include both new construction and acquisition and rehabilitation developments, noting that new construction has historically achieved better leveraging of public and private financing, thereby minimizing City subsidies and maximizing the reach of City housing trust funds. Finally, the Housing Commission recommends that the eligible uses of the RRHTF allow for rental-subsidy programs, subject to Council approval regarding specific programs. With respect to eligible borrowers, and consistent with current Housing Trust Fund Guidelines policy, the Housing Commission also recommends that eligibility for the new trust fund be limited to nonprofit affordable housing organizations and limited partnerships with a nonprofit general partner. In summary, the Housing Commission recommends:         Creation of a new housing trust fund (Redevelopment Replacement Housing Trust Fund) for revenue received from Measure GSH and any matching funds allocated by Council; and          Guidelines for the new housing trust fund establishing:o       Eligible uses include affordable housing created through new construction and acquisition/rehabilitation, as well as rental subsidies, if a specific program is approved by Council o       Funds be targeted to households with incomes at or below 80 percent of area median income; and o       Eligible borrowers must be nonprofit housing organizations. One area of clarification involves the requirement, pursuant to State law, that 20 percent of any loan payments from the former RDA to the City be deposited into a Low-Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund (LMIHAF). The existing Redevelopment Housing Trust Fund (RHTF) serves as the LMIHAF and is subject to specific regulatory restrictions regarding eligible uses and affordability targeting. Therefore, staff recommends continuing to direct 80 percent of RDA loan repayments to the RRHTF, which is subject to local discretion only, and 20 percent to the existing RHTF, in order to facilitate the appropriate use, tracking, reporting, and compliance associated with the affordable housing revenue. Additionally, to avoid confusion between the existing RHTF and the proposed RRHTF, staff recommends renaming the existing RHTF to the Low-Moderate Income Housing Asset Trust Fund (LMIHATF). Public Planning and Reporting Procedures for All Housing Trust FundsThe Housing Commission recommends establishing housing trust fund priorities aligned with the adopted Housing Elements affordable housing production goals. Under California law, the City is required to periodically prepare a Housing Element which must be approved by the State. The Citys current Housing Element covers the period from 2014 through 2021 and includes Quantified Objectives for housing production based on the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (the RHNA is conducted by the Southern California Association of Governments). Quantified Objectives established in the Housing Element already provide a guide as to affordability level (extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-income) goals. To inform priorities for housing trust funds allocations, the Housing Commission recommends aligning with the Housing Element planning cycle and using that process to refine affordable housing production goals with respect to housing type (family, senior, special needs, etc.) and size (bedroom mix). In addition to achieving harmony among affordable housing production policy and housing trust fund priorities, the Housing Commission aims to ensure transparency and accountability regarding the use of all housing trust funds. Therefore, the Commission recommends the following planning, public input, and reporting procedures be included in the Housing Trust Fund Guidelines:         Staff shall prepare a proposed Initial Plan for affordable housing development for the remaining period covered by the current Housing Element (i.e., though 2021);          Staff shall make the proposed initial plan available online, for a 45-day period for written public comment, and hold a public hearing (which staff recommends be hosted by the Housing Commission) between the 30th and 45th day of the comment period (to receive additional/final public comment);          Proposed initial plan shall be submitted with public comment to the Housing Commission for review and advisory recommendations, and then to the Council for consideration and approval;          Annually thereafter, the Housing Division shall submit a report to the Housing Commission, along with any proposed amendments to the Council-adopted initial plan, detailing the following information: (1)   source and amount of funds received into each housing trust fund during the prior year; (2)   amount and uses of funds expended from each housing trust fund during the prior year; (3)   quantity and type of affordable housing made available for occupancy during the prior year; (4)   quantity and type of affordable housing which exceeded or fell below the annual production mandate of Proposition R during the prior year; (5)   cumulative figures of source/amount of housing trust funds, quantity/type of affordable housing made available, and exceeded/missed Proposition R requirement, covering the Housing Element period, as well as a comparison with the Quantified Objectives set forth in the Housing Element; and  (6)   comparison of the actual cumulative affordable housing production covering the period of the adopted Initial Plan with the goals set forth in that plan.  One clarification staff recommends is that the annual report information described in Item 2 above also include the amount and source of funding commitments issued during the prior year. Such information will make clear the resulting unencumbered trust fund balances available at the end of each reporting period. Increasing Transparency for All Housing Trust FundsThe Housing Commission recommends several measures to provide easy and prompt access to housing trust fund information. These include online posting, automated email notification to the public, and public meetings regarding loan commitments. For online postings, the Commission recommends that information be available in one online location, clearly identified as Housing Trust Funds on the Housing Division website, and include the following relevant information within one week of becoming public:(1)  current Housing Trust Funds Guidelines; (2)  all documents generated and made public by the City Manager, the Housing Division, the Housing Commission, and the City Council pursuant to the affordable housing planning and reporting process; (3)  written explanation of the Citys decisions to approve or reject applications; (4)  all loan commitment letters issued; (5)  all notices of the required public meeting following a loan commitment; and (6)  all annual reports provided by the Housing Trust Fund recipients (redacted for privacy).  Another measure the Housing Commission recommends is the creation of an automated notification service whereby members of the public can register to receive emails when new housing trust fund information (as described above) is posted on the website. Furthermore, the Housing Commission recommends that loan commitment recipients hold a public meeting about the associated affordable housing. The public meeting must occur within 30 days of the loan commitment, and the recipient must provide a document giving notice of the date, time and location of the public meeting to the Housing Division at least 15 days prior to the public meeting date. One clarification staff recommends is that the posting of information described in Items 1-6 above be applied prospectively, given the 30-year history of housing trust fund loans.  Revisions to Loan Approval ProcessCurrent Guidelines prescribe an administrative process for the review and approval of loan applications involving both new construction and acquisition/rehabilitation affordable housing developments. The process has proven effective in creating affordable housing for families, individuals, seniors, persons living with disabilities, and persons experiencing homelessness. Administrative loan approval allows applicants to be competitive in the Santa Monica marketplace, where property acquisition opportunities suitable for affordable housing are sporadic and highly competitive. The loan application and approval process includes these components:         Loan application submitted (applicant)         Due diligence and underwriting (City and applicant and other public/private lenders/investors)         Loan Committee Report issued w/recommendations (City)         Loan Committee meeting  approve/deny loan (City)         Loan Commitment letter issued with conditions for final loan approval (City)         Loan Documents preparation, review, negotiation, and execution (City and applicant and other public/private lenders/investors)          Escrow closing/property acquisition (City and applicant and other public/private lenders/investors) Historically, only nonprofit affordable housing organizations and partnerships have applied for housing trust fund loans, although two of the five existing housing trust funds allow for-profit applicants. Long-standing protocol requires that staff prepare an internal Loan Committee Report which provides an overview of the proposed affordable housing, target population, affordability levels, sources and uses of funds including any proposed vouchers from the Housing Authority, due diligence conclusions, and the general basis for recommending approval (or denial) of the proposed affordable housing loan. To increase transparency and document in detail the rationale regarding the decision-making aspect of the loan approval process, the Housing Commission recommends that staff prepare and make public a written statement explaining the reasons for approving or denying a loan request. The written statement should address the merits of the loan application evaluated under the criteria enumerated in the Guidelines:         Significantly increase affordable housing opportunities for households who have difficulty finding housing including the homeless, large families, the disabled, seniors, and persons traditionally served by Single-Room Occupancy housing         Are cost-effective or achieve the lowest possible subsidy per unit for City/Agency resources         Benefit a high percentage of very low- and low-income households by ensuring deeper affordability         Are located in areas currently underserved by affordable housing developments         Address an area of need identified in the Housing Element of the City of Santa MonicaThe Housing Commission further recommends that two additional criteria be included to evaluate a loan application and addressed in the written statement:         Whether the proposed affordable housing addresses a particular need identified in the Council-approved Initial Plan (described earlier in this report); and          Applicants past and projected effectiveness implementing the City-established local preferences (i.e., households that live or work in Santa Monica).The practical effect of evaluating an applicants effectiveness in achieving the Citys local preference goals could favor housing providers who administer their waiting lists in a manner where only households who live or work in Santa Monica are beneficiaries of City-funded affordable housing. The Housing Commission also recommends the Guidelines be revised to clarify that a commitment letter issued by the City shall be signed by the Housing Division Manager and the Director of Housing and Economic Development (a protocol which has been in practice for years). Furthermore, at its May 18, 2017 meeting, the Housing Commission appointed a two-member subcommittee to observe the loan approval decision-making process to facilitate a future discussion regarding other possible recommended changes to the Guidelines. Staff will coordinate with the subcommittee to assist them in achieving familiarity with the details of the loan approval process.Of final note is the Housing Commissions recommendation regarding the loan approval process as it relates to the intersection of public input and compliance with fair housing laws. The Commission report notes that a significant portion of public comment (about possible revisions to the existing Guidelines) involves a recent housing trust fund loan for affordable housing targeted to persons living with disabilities. Concerned that the City should tread cautiously to avoid creating impediments to fair housing (e.g., like imposing a requirement on the developer to conduct a public meeting after a loan commitment has been issued) while simultaneously establishing policies for robust public input regarding affordable housing spending priorities, the Commission recommends, that City Council direct the City Attorney to review existing guidelines and procedures and provide legal advice regarding whether any changes are appropriate. Accordingly, the City Attorneys Office will review the Guidelines for fair housing compliance and staff will return to Council with amendments, if warranted.  Maximum Loan and Developer Fee LimitsThe maximum housing trust fund loan (and grant) limits pursuant to the current Guidelines are established on a per-unit basis and adjusted annually based upon a Council-approved methodology linked to changes in land and construction costs (see Municipal Code Section 9.64.070{b}). The FY2017-18 limits are illustrated in the table below: Fiscal Year 2017-18$492,848$613,710$518,363$645,940 Loans in excess of the maximum (per-unit) amounts must be approved by the City Council, as well as loans involving more than 50 residences. The Housing Commission noted that the combination of the two limits (a per-unit loan limit and a 50-unit loan limit) results in substantial administrative authority for loan approval. In that context, the Commission recommends revising the Guidelines to include an aggregate loan/grant limit of $15 million per affordable housing development. Any loan/grant exceeding $15 million would require City Council approval. The proposed $15 million aggregate loan limit raises a few issues. One issue involves a potential disconnect between proprietary and regulatory policies intended to facilitate affordable housing. Since 2005, the Guidelines have included the 50-residence loan limit for affordable housing funding. Similarly, the zoning code provides for administrative approval of affordable housing developments containing 50 residences or fewer. (On July 11, 2017, City Council endorsed a final draft Downtown Community Plan which would allow administrative approval for affordable housing developments.) Revising the current Guidelines to add a $15 million loan limit could result in misalignment of streamlining measures for affordable housing development. For example, a proposed affordable housing development involving 45 residences with an average loan subsidy of $350,000 per residence would require Council approval (45 x $350,000 = $15,750,000), though the housing would not require discretionary approvals.  An additional challenge is that competing for other financing to leverage City funds (such as Low Income Housing Tax Credits) cannot occur until all discretionary approvals are obtained, which can create delays in proposed housing, given application periods are limited to once or twice year. With respect to preservation of existing housing through acquisition and rehabilitation, the proposed $15 million loan limit could limit such opportunities to properties with less than 28 residences, given that recent City loans have averaged $550,000 per residence ($550,000 x 28 = $15,400,000), as sellers may be reluctant to accept purchase offers subject to Council approval.Finally, the Housing Commissions report notes that public comment received involved the issue of increasing the developer fee limit. The base limit amount allowed for the developer fee was last established for the fiscal 2007-08 period, although the amount is adjusted annually per the Guidelines. The Commission did not have adequate opportunity to study and evaluate the issue of developer fee limits, but intends to consider the matter in the future and make a recommendation to Council. Next StepsAn additional issue staff would like to address which was not part of the Housing Commission report involves updating the sustainability goals in affordable housing which would be eligible for financing by housing trust funds (see Exhibit D of the Guidelines, Green Affordable Housing Checklist). Staff will collaborate with the Citys Office of Sustainability and the Environment to prepare recommended updates to Exhibit D, seeking a balance between integrating effective (and required) sustainability features, recognizing the cost-effectiveness thresholds of other public funding programs, and requiring leveraging from federal/state/local sustainability programs where available. Staff would review with the Housing Commission any proposed changes to Exhibit D, and then return to Council with recommendations.SummaryThe following table summarizes the proposed revisions to the Housing Trust Fund Guidelines:         Creation of new Housing Trust Fund for Measure GSH revenues and matching General Funds allocated by Council         Targeting households with incomes at or below 80 percent of Area Median Income.         Eligible Uses includes new construction, acquisition and rehabilitation, and Council-approved rental subsidy programs.         Eligible borrowers must be nonprofit housing organizations and partnerships with a nonprofit general partner.         Alignment of Housing Trust Fund priorities with the adopted Housing Elements affordable housing production goals.          Planning, public input, and reporting procedures tied to the Housing Element cycle.          Housing Trust Funds annual report.          One online location identified as Housing Trust Funds         All relevant information available online.         Automated notification service for members of the public.         Written statement explaining reasons for approving or denying a loan request.         Two additional criteria be included to evaluate a loan application         Commitment letter be signed by the Housing Manager and the Director of Housing and Economic Development.         City Council approval required for any loan and or grant exceeding $15 million         Staff will collaborate with the Citys Office of Sustainability and the Environment to update Exhibit D of the Housing Trust Funds Guidelines.", "background": "Santa Monica has a long history of leadership in Southern California for championing housing affordability. Voter-approved affordable housing goals are achieved through a variety of City policies, including rent control, zoning regulations such as the Affordable Housing Production Program, as well as investments in the production and preservation of affordable housing via the Citys housing trust funds. Prior to 1998, staff administered five different affordable housing trust funds, each with separate guidelines involving eligibility requirements, loan terms, and other conditions, creating complexity and inconsistency amongst the funds. On November 24, 1998 (Attachment B), City Council approved consolidation of the various trust fund guidelines into a single set covering all of the housing trust funds. Since 1998, City Council has revisited and amended the Guidelines on five occasions to reflect updated market conditions and best practices. The current Guidelines establish uniform loan terms and conditions among the five trust funds, while recognizing unique eligibility requirements, where applicable, based upon each trust fund revenue source. Prior to the State-mandated dissolution of redevelopment agencies in 2012, the Citys redevelopment tax increment revenue was the primary local funding source for the production and preservation of affordable housing in Santa Monica. Such funding amounted to approximately $15 million annually and financed affordable housing through loans to nonprofit housing organizations. In November 2016, Santa Monica voters approved Measures GS and GSH, which together create a new source of locally controlled revenue and direct one-half of the revenue toward affordable housing purposes. The new tax is expected to generate approximately $8 million annually. In addition, Council dedicated proceeds from the repayment of City loans to the former Redevelopment Agency, toward affordable housing. Proceeds are estimated to average approximately $8 million annually for the next seven years.The Housing Commissions review of the Guidelines evaluated whether amendments are warranted. Prior to forming recommendations, the Commission sought public comment on the existing Guidelines by proactively contacting the Citys established neighborhood groups, as well as other stakeholders. Additionally, notice seeking public comment was published on the Housing Divisions website. Commissioners requested comments on the following items: (1) specific guidelines for a Redevelopment Replacement Housing Trust Fund (involving the new voter-approved funding and any General Funds allocated by Council from RDA loan repayments); (2) general guidelines applicable to all housing trust funds; (3) planning and reporting procedures; and (4) the decision-making process for approving affordable housing loans. Written responses from 16 individuals and organizations were received and considered by the Housing Commission (Attachment C).

Administrative Item", "body": {"other": "Pursuant to Councils direction, staff conducted in-depth interviews with survey participants, researched residual-income (after-rent) program models, and analyzed the potential budget and participation figures. The Housing Commission held detailed discussions regarding the POD program on April 20, 2017 (Attachment H) and May 18, 2017 (Attachment I), and approved recommendations regarding the pilot-program design (Attachment J).  Expert Opinion Regarding Basic Living Costs To conduct the analysis requested by Council, staff needed a standard for basic needs budgets. The Housing Commission Chair facilitated a meeting with the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research team that created the Elder Economic Security Standard Index for California (Attachment K) and its Basic Needs Budget. For specifics, see the Elder Index Methodology Report (Attachment L).  Staff found the Elder Index Basic Needs Budget to be best suited to consider residual income for the POD pilot program because it is tailored for seniors (the majority of anticipated pilot participants), it includes data sets regarding seniors in Los Angeles County, and it delineates rent and non-rent expenditures. Using the most recent data for Los Angeles County (2013), the UCLA Elder Index calculates household Basic Needs Budgets as follows:(2013 Los Angeles County Fair Market Rent+ Utilities Assumptions)Food$264$490Healthcare$166$332Transportation$233$326Misc. (clothing, household expenses, etc.)$216$313$2,050$2,632$24,600$31,584Comparatively, and as shown on the following chart for one- and two-person households, the Basic Needs Budget income levels are above Federal Poverty Guidelines, above 30 percent of area median income (extremely low-income), and below 50 percent of area median income (very low income) for Los Angeles County in 2017.  To align the POD program with Santa Monica policies, the Housing Commission recommended adjustment of two of the Elder Index Basic Needs Budget assumptions. Utilities were adjusted to amounts that match the Santa Monica Housing Authoritys average utility allowances for currently served tenants. To ensure that POD does not subsidize private automobile usage, transportation was adjusted down from $233 (based on national averages of annual miles driven multiplied by the Internal Revenue Service standard mileage reimbursement rate) to $52 (the rounded cost of a 30-day senior EZ Transit Pass for the Big Blue Bus and Metro).  The Housing Commission voted to recommend that the POD program use the Basic Needs Subsidy Method with the above-stated proposed budget adjustments. The formula for household subsidy would be as follows:Total Annual Income less Rent = Annual Non-Rent IncomeDifference Between Annual Non-Rent Income and Basic Needs Budget Non-Rent Expenses = Annual SubsidyAnnual Subsidy divided by 12 = Monthly Subsidy The Basic Needs Budget (BNB) for the POD pilot is proposed to include the following expenses and amounts per household size.  Food$264$490Healthcare$166$332Transportation$52$103Utilities$42$55Misc. (clothing, hhld. expenses, etc.)$216$313$1,293Total Annual Non-Rent Expenses$8,880$15,516 To ensure program consistency and ease of implementation during the pilot phase, no other adjustments are proposed to be made to the BNB or subsidy allocations during the pilot year, although staff would document any opportunities or challenges during the pilot phase that could inform potential program expansion. Program Eligibility CriteriaFrom the larger group who completed the Renter Needs Survey, staff requested interviews with 103 surveyed households whose self-reported income qualified them as extremely low-income (earning less than $18,250 annually for a one-person household). From January through March 2017, a total of 46 households participated in the interviews (interview cohort). Staff analyzed program designs and costs based on averages of the interview cohorts self-reported income, assets, resources, and expenses.  Staff applied the proposed Basic Needs Budget (with local adjustments) to the interview cohort of 46 households, added the anticipated two percent rent increase as of September 1, 2017, and then filtered for the Housing Commissions recommended Threshold Eligibility Criteria as outlined in the Guidelines and as follows:  Threshold Eligibility Criteria for the POD pilot (household must meet all criteria below):1.     Household submitted a complete Renter Needs Survey by July 18, 2016;2.     Household participated in follow-up interviews;3.     Head of household is a senior aged 62 or older; 4.     Household has occupied current Santa Monica rent-controlled apartment since before January 1, 2000; 5.     Households apartment must not be deed-restricted affordable housing of any kind, including:         Properties purchased, rehabilitated, or constructed with City funding;           Apartments subject to the Affordable Housing Production Program;          Federally assisted properties; and          Los Angeles County-assisted or owned affordable housing properties.  6.     Renter Needs Survey initially indicated that the household income was equal to or less than 30 percent of area median income (Extremely low income) and household final income verification confirms it is no more than 50 percent area median income (Low Income); 7.     Household is not currently participating in, or previously terminated from, any Santa Monica Housing Authority rent-subsidy programs; 8.     No household members convicted of violent crime which occurred within the last 5 years, or who are registered sex offenders; and 9.     Household income documentation indicates that the household is in need of the subsidy (i.e. earning less than the approved Basic Needs Budget), pursuant to the income and asset determinations and verifications outlined in Section III of the Guidelines, including but not limited to:          Earned and unearned income for all household members from all sources, such as employment, cash-equivalent government benefits, and family support; and         Imputed income for assets calculated at a rate of 10 percent  annually (the formula for the Citys Affordable Housing Production Program). From among the 46 interviewed households, 26 households met all of the above criteria. If the Council approves the program model and guidelines, and once all threshold criteria are verified by staff, the 26 households would comprise the pilot cohort. The following figure demonstrates the selection process:  Figure 1: Participant Selection for Pilot Cohort Of the 26 potential pilot cohort households, there are 22 one-person households and 4 two-person households. The average head of household age is 72 years. Average annual income is $13,763 for a one-person household and $19,281 for a two-person household. All 26 households experience rent burden at more than 30 percent of income paid toward rent, with 22 households severely rent burdened at more than 50 percent of income paid toward rent.  Pilot BudgetApplying the adjusted Basic Needs Budget to the pilot cohort, the total annual 12-month POD subsidy budget for the qualified households at their current rent would equal $149,844 as shown below:1$273$740$467$10,280$123,360222112$742$1,293$551$2,207$26,484431Total POD Costs$12,487$149,84426242Average Per Household$480$5,763    Due to evaluation scheduled at the 12-month mark, staff recommends that the initial pilot subsidies continue for 14 months. The additional two months would provide time to analyze 12-month program data and present the findings to the Housing Commission and Council in order to inform the future of the POD program. A 14-month subsidy budget would total $182,210 as follows: 1$280$740$460$10,128$141,792222112$572$1,293$721$2,887$40,418431 Total POD Costs$13,015$182,21026242Average Per Household$501$7,008    There are several potential challenges in implementing the Basic Needs Subsidy Method. First, for at least two of the households, the subsidy needed to meet basic needs exceeds the households rent. As a result, the Housing Commission recommended that the subsidies not be capped at the amount of rent. Second, some property owners may refuse to accept the POD subsidy. In such cases, the Housing Commission recommends that the POD subsidy be paid directly to tenants. Third, as a result of any direct payment to tenants, there could be both personal income tax implications and deductions from the amount of assistance that participants receive from other government programs. During the pilot phase, staff would document any challenges associated with direct payments in order to inform potential program expansion.  Comparing Costs of the Subsidy MethodFor the POD pilot cohort, the Basic Needs Method costs less than the traditional rent subsidy method that looks at rent burden only. If the Traditional Rent Subsidy (the Section 8 model) were applied to the 26 households above for a 12-month period, the total subsidy budget would be almost $40,000 above the 12-month POD subsidy budget of $149,844 for a total of $184,788.  ", "background": "In December 2015, the Housing Commission presented a report to Council recommending affordable housing strategies to preserve Santa Monicas economic diversity and bolster housing security for residents (Attachment B). One of the proposed strategies aimed to assist lower-income Santa Monica residents to remain in their rent-controlled homes by providing rental assistance.  On May 10, 2016, Council directed staff to explore expanding affordable housing policies to include a local rent-subsidy program to assist low-income residents who currently live in rent-controlled apartments and who are severely rent-burdened (Attachment C). On June 14, 2016, Council allocated $300,000 of the FY2016-17 budget toward the pilot program, with $100,000 allocated to administration and $200,000 to rent assistance (Attachment D).  The goals of the Preserving Our Diversity (POD) program are to: 1)     Help low-income senior residents avoid residential displacement by reducing household rent burden; 2)     Assist some of the Citys lowest-income and longest-term residents to live with greater dignity by helping them meet their basic needs, such as rent, food, medical care, and transportation, and by facilitating access to mainstream goods and services; 3)     Provide an opportunity for the City to gauge the effectiveness of POD as a housing preservation and anti-displacement strategy and model; and 4)     Identify key issues to address in conjunction with considering any program expansion. From June 24, 2016, to July 18, 2016, staff distributed a Renter Needs Survey to approximately 27,500 Santa Monica households living in rent-controlled apartments to assess the magnitude of need among low-income residents. The Renter Needs Survey also functioned as a pre-application for the POD pilot program. A total 814 surveys were returned by the deadline. Analysis of the surveys was narrowed to 433 households living in rent-controlled apartments not subject to government affordability covenants. Refer to Attachment E for charts illustrating the demographics of survey households. The survey confirmed that a subset of Santa Monicas long-term residents in rent-controlled housing are extremely low-income (earning less than 30 percent of the area median income), rent-burdened (paying over 30 percent of income toward rent), seniors (average age 68), mostly living alone (average household size of 1.2 people), and with very little after-rent income to pay for basic needs (average $200 per month). At the Housing Commissions June 16, 2016, meeting, staff presented draft guidelines for the proposed POD Program (Attachment F) and obtained feedback.  On November 22, 2016, staff recommended a POD pilot model to Council (Attachment G) based on analysis of the 433 survey households. Council discussed the proposal and directed staff to consider the following, in consultation with the Housing Commission:         Using residual income available after rent as the subsidy metric;         Obtaining expert opinion regarding basic living costs;          Prioritizing long-term residents of rent-controlled housing         Maximizing the reach of the pilot program;         Directing additional services and resources to pilot participants, including connecting participants to existing programs and services that are available to low-income households, as well as connecting working-age participants with job resources and education; and,         Considering a local nonprofit to administer the program.", "summary": "The Preserving Our Diversity program is a pilot that aims to support the Councils strategic goal of maintaining an inclusive and diverse community by providing financial assistance to low-income, long-term residents, aged 62 and older, who live in rent-controlled apartments and whose inability to pay rent may result in displacement from Santa Monica. Based on the proposed eligibility criteria recommended by the Housing Commission, the one-year pilot program would serve 26 senior households, with the goal of ensuring that the households have sufficient resources to meet their basic needs.

Parking demand in the area is moderate due to its moderately-dense residential nature as well as its proximity to the successful business district along Ocean Park Boulevard. City Council previously approved the 26th Street between Ocean Park Place North and Pearl Street, as well as the surrounding streets as Zone DD. As a result, there is no subsequent need to conduct utilization studies.  Community InputResidents along 26th Street and the Friends of Sunset Park Neighborhood Association were notified of the proposed preferential parking zone by mail several times in each of the three preceding months and invited to attend a June 15, 2017 evening community meeting at the Pico Branch of the Santa Monica Public Library to discuss preferential parking. A summary of the comments received at the meeting are listed below:         Residents expressed a preference for regulations limiting on-street parking to residents and no parking for those without permits during the day;         Residents expressed concern regarding employees working at Ocean Park Boulevard businesses parking on 26th Street;         Further, these same employees scramble to move their vehicles just before the onset of the existing 10 AM to 2 PM parking prohibition and then returning afterwards, causing undesired speeding and other behavior concerns; and         Some residents were initially opposed to any preferential parking regulations and voiced concerns regarding inconvenience, cost of parking permits, and difficultly for visitors to park.  Nevertheless, residents have come together and have now exceeded the required supermajority of 66%, with 93% of households in favor of moving forward with the residential permit zone as proposed. Recommended Preferential Parking RegulationsBased on previous City Council pre-qualifications for this part of town and the community comments stating the difficulty of finding street parking and a desire for preferential parking, staff recommends approving the following preferential parking regulations for the following block:         26th Street between Pearl Street and Ocean Park Place North with the regulation No parking, 9 A.M. to 6 P.M., Monday to Friday, except by permit.As the intention of preferential parking is to improve access to street parking for block residents and as the parking located on the 26th Street is adjacent to pedestrian access to Ocean Park Boulevard and is frequently used by employees of Ocean Park Boulevard businesses, staff recommends the proposed preferential parking regulations be applied to the parking along this segment of 26th Street.AlternativesThe Council could maintain the existing parking regulations including pre-approved preferential parking, or adopt different hours and types of restrictions than recommended. Environmental AnalysisThe proposed project has been determined to be categorically exempt from the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), pursuant to Article 19, Section 15301 (c) which defines Class 1 exempt projects in the following way: Class 1 consists of the operation, repair, maintenance, permitting, leasing, licensing, or minor alteration of existing public or private structures, facilities, mechanical equipment, or topographical features, involving negligible or no expansion of use beyond that existing at the time of the lead agencys determination. The exemption includes: Existing highways and streets, sidewalks, gutters, bicycle and pedestrian trails, and similar facilities. Preferential parking zones involve only the issuance of permits for the use of an existing public street and include negligible or no expansion of the existing use. Next StepsIf preferential parking regulations are approved, regulations would be implemented on the 2400 to 2600 block of 26th Street within seven (7) weeks. This allows time for: residents to apply for permits, staff to process applications, signs to be ordered, manufactured, and installed, and a grace period between the installation of signs and the enforcement of preferential parking regulations.  ", "background": "Preferential parking is a tool the City uses to manage non-resident parking use on residential streets, as authorized by Santa Monica Municipal Code Chapter 3.08 and the California Vehicle Code. Preferential parking regulations manage the use of on-street parking to make parking more available for residents near their home. Only residents who live on a block with preferential parking restrictions are eligible to purchase a permit. Permits may be used within two block faces of the permit holders address.Residents may petition to initiate a preferential parking zone at any time. Typically, upon receipt of a petition representing two-thirds of the residential units on a block, a parking occupancy study of the neighborhood is conducted and a community meeting is held. In evaluating the petitions, staff typically evaluates the larger neighborhood rather than an individual block in order to account for parking displacement when regulations are established or changed. As a result, staff typically recommends that the Council preapprove preferential parking regulations for more than one block to streamline and expedite the process for adjacent blocks should some displacement occur. However, when the surrounding residential streets are already served by residential permit parking, it is unnecessary to conduct further parking utilization studies. Once Council approves preferential parking regulations, they are implemented on the block or blocks that have submitted qualifying petitions. Preferential parking regulations are not implemented on blocks that have been pre-approved by the Council until the time that the residents of those blocks submit qualifying petitions representing two-thirds of the residential units on the block.  ", "summary": "Residents of the 2400 to 2600 block of 26th Street have submitted qualifying petitions for preferential parking regulations.

This package would also include non-reimbursable measures to replace light poles at Beach Lot 1 at 1550 PCH, new fixtures at Reed Park, and install a new carbon monoxide (CO) detection system and variable speed drives to control five garage exhaust fans in Parking Structure 9. The system would monitor CO levels and operate the fans at the minimum speed required to maintain acceptable CO concentrations.  While not all measures are covered by SCEs rebate and on-bill financing programs, replacing or upgrading the systems is still recommended by staff.

This program offers reimbursements for eligible expenses incurred to complete the lighting upgrades. Rebates are issued directly and the OBF, which is a 0% interest loan, is repaid over time through a charge on the Citys monthly utility bill. Approval on all 12 submitted applications is expected to be received in summer 2017. Staff recommends entering into an OBF agreement with SCE in an estimated amount of $785,802 in FY 2017-18 to fund the eligible energy efficiency measures.  When the proposed conversion project is completed, SCE would conduct a final inspection and issue a rebate check and OBF loan proceeds check which, together, would reimburse the City for the cost of construction with the exception of $71,200. SCE would then add a monthly loan repayment charge to the utility accounts impacted. The monthly payment is calculated to be equal to the energy cost savings generated by the project, allowing the City to continue paying the same amount to SCE with no budget changes needed. Once the loan is repaid, the energy cost savings would revert to the General Fund.

In addition, the City created the Sustainable Water Master Plan to reduce water use by 20% and be 100% water self-sufficient by 2020. According to the Citys Water Resources Division, in 2016, City landscaping accounted for 57% of the City governments total water usage. On March 22, 2016 (Attachment B), Council awarded the purchase of 39 Calsense smart irrigation controllers, including component parts, to Smith Pipe & Supply, Inc. in an amount not to exceed $328,726.  Although Santa Monica is meeting its local water conservation goal of 20% below 2013 usage levels, it must continue to meet this target for long-term resiliency and water self-sufficiency. Santa Monicas groundwater, the Citys major supply of water, has been impacted by the long-term effects of the drought and can take years to rebound. Continuing conservation efforts will help the City achieve its water self-sufficiency goal, ending the need to rely on imported water to meet the demands of the community.  The City is maintaining its current drought restrictions including water use allowances and penalties for exceeding allowances. In a continuing effort to support the Citys drought response, Public Landscape Division staff sought to continue the replacement of current irrigation controllers, the devices that operate automatic irrigation systems, used throughout the Citys parks, landscape sites and other City property. Calsense smart irrigation controllers conserve water by automatically adjusting to climate and environmental changes, such as rain and cooling periods, by collecting daily real-time data specific to this region from the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) station located in Santa Monica. Further, smart controllers detect mainline and sprinkler line breaks with the use of flow meters and master valves. ", "summary": "The City continues to implement water efficiency measures in response to the statewide drought and the goal to attain water self-sufficiency by 2020.

Advancement of the design (beyond the required 60% for establishing a GMP) allows for faster completion of the final design and beginning of construction, and provides additional certainty for the GMP not-to-exceed amount.The scope of work covered by the GMP includes:         Constructing six new connecting taxiways, approximately 65-feet wide by 150-feet long each, at the ends of the runway and approximately midway.         Implementing drainage improvements to accommodate the new connecting taxiways.         Procuring and installing new navigational aids including Precision Approach Path Indicators (PAPIs) and Runway End Identifier Lights (REILs)         Rubber removal and crack sealing of the runway keel section (the middle section of the runway that sees the most aircraft traffic and where the majority of touchdowns occur).         Runway and taxiway striping, including over 44,000 SF of runway striping and over 13,000 SF of taxiway striping.         Installation of new runway and taxiway lights, including 2-miles of conduit and 4-miles of cables.         Constructing barriers to protect adjacent uses.         Relocating the existing wind cone.         Implementing new aircraft run-up areas and hold aprons.         Conducting noise monitoring and noise mitigation as necessary and in compliance with CEQA and City ordinances.Community Outreach and NotificationsBased on the amount of work required, completion of the runway shortening by December 31, 2017 will necessitate construction to be done at night to moderate impacts to existing operations and potential FAA objections. Noise monitoring and mitigation measures will be implemented during night work. Additionally, full runway closures between 7 and 14 consecutive days are also envisioned to facilitate completion of work within the Runway Safety Area. The schedule and duration of night work and full closures will be organized to enable the most expeditious completion timeline, while mitigating operational restrictions at the Airport.For night work, anticipated to occur between 9PM and 7AM, the project team will notify residents and tenants in accordance with the City guidelines.

Vendor/Consultant SelectionAECOM was selected as the Design-Build firm for runway shortening through a competitive process that was initiated in February 2017 when the City issued a Request for Proposals letter (RFP #2500) for aviation planning and engineering services to shorten the runway at SMO. Pursuant to that process, in March 2017, the City and AECOM executed a feasibility / design-build agreement under which options for runway shortening were developed and presented to Council in May 2017 for selection and further development to establish a GMP and execute a Design-Build Agreement for completing runway shortening prior to the end of December 2017.Next StepsUpon Council approval of the GMP and Design-Build Agreement, staff anticipates the following project timeline:         Final Design Completion - August 2017         Site Preparation and Start of Construction - October 2017         Construction Completion - December 2017", "background": "On February 28, 2017, the City of Santa Monica executed a Feasibility Professional Services Agreement 10436 (CCS) with AECOM (Attachment A), which engaged AECOM to study reducing Runway 03-21 at SMO to 3,500 feet. The agreement included an initial feasibility phase to provide runway-shortening options for Council consideration and selection. On April 24, 2017,  staff issued an Information Item (Attachment B) responding to Councils inquiry about a potential phased interim project, removal of pavement at the ends of the runway, and evaluation of future uses of the excess runway area. The Information Item provided an update on those topics, as well as the overall status of the runway-shortening project. On May 24, 2017, Council selected Option B, the center-aligned shortened runway option (Attachment C) from the two options presented for runway shortening construction. The Council directed staff to proceed with further design of the preferred option and to establish a GMP for a design-build agreement between the City and AECOM to complete runway-shortening construction prior to December 31, 2017.

Earlier this year, the City and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) entered into an historic Settlement Agreement and Consent Decree to resolve the Citys litigation to secure local control. On February 1, 2017, the United States District Court for the Central District of California entered an Order approving the Settlement Agreement as a Consent Decree. Among other provisions, the Consent Decree allows the City to reduce the runway to 3,500 feet pending the Citys right to close the Airport to aviation uses after December 31, 2028. Reducing the operational length of the runway to 3,500 feet would reduce the adverse environmental, health, and safety concerns that current Airport operations impose on residents of Santa Monica and adjacent neighbors, including reducing jet traffic, noise impacts and air emissions. Specifically, shortening the runway to 3,500 feet would reduce use of the Airport by larger aircraft (by an estimated 44% according to a study by Coffman Associates) and consequently reduce Community Noise Equivalent Level contours, result in fewer overall exceedances of Single Event Noise Levels, and reduce the impact of aircraft exhaust and fumes on surrounding residential neighborhoods. While the potential future uses of excess runway surface or released land is separate from the runway shortening project, staff has begun the process of developing options for removal of excess runway pavement (as the result of the runway shortening) which will be presented to Council in late-September 2017.

The NextBus service allows BBB to make this information available by phone, SMS text, online and through a smartphone application. Subscribing to the NextBus service has enabled BBB to make real-time information accessible to the visually and hearing impaired, as the NextBus website is ADA-compliant. The Telephone Information Service is designed to allow visually impaired customers to key in stop codes in order to hear an audible announcement providing information. NextBus also allows agency staff to enter stop- and/or route-specific service alerts, which further expand the capacity to disseminate information aiding customers in trip planning. Customers who are visually impaired can access these announcements by phone. Finally, through its website and mobile app, customers can customize notification alerts through My NextBus Alerts, a feature that pushes alerts via SMS, email or a web browser when a particular bus is set to arrive. BBB currently sees a high volume of NextBus usage. In particular, there are a large number of users that take advantage of accessing the information for BBB via phone and text relative to other transit agencies. This may be due in part to the fact that BBB posts NextBus information at all stops, while some other transit agencies do not. BBB has seen a 58% decline in phone call volumes to its customer service line from FY16-FY17, and a 75% decline between FY14 and FY17. BBB believes that the expanded accessibility to scheduled and real-time bus arrival information across multiple formats, including through NextBus, is largely responsible for this decline. The data generated by the NextBus system is owned by the City of Santa Monica. Since launching NextBus in June 2015, Big Blue Bus customers have been able to access real-time bus arrival information over 14 million times. Website & iOS and Android App Hits 64,864154,3619116,20513,829,128 Redundancy and AlternativesIn order to build on the real-time bus arrival information availability and reliability, BBB continued to explore additional options for making information available to customers. Staff researched emerging technologies in real-time transit information and identified the Southern California 511 system as an additional option. Southern California 511 (511), is a free traveler information service that gives commuters live traffic reports, transit planning, commuter service information, motorist aid, or FasTrak information in the Southern California area through a toll-free phone number, website and mobile application.  BBB seeks to integrate the NextBus XML feed into Southern California 511, as discussed below. Including BBBs real-time travel data in Southern California 511 through the NextBus Extensible Markup Language (XML) feed would further expand access to this information in both English and Spanish. Big Blue Bus seeks to modify the contract with NextBus to include the setup and release of NextBus real-time information as an XML feed to third parties, through the NextBus Application Program Interface (API). By making NextBus data available in this format, the Los Angeles County Service Authority for Freeway Emergencies (LA SAFE) will be able to include Big Blue Bus real-time arrival information in the updated version of 511, launched July 1, 2017. The next version of Southern California 511 includes: an overhaul of Go511, LA SAFEs website and mobile app; the introduction of SMS texting as a way to access real-time transit arrivals and traffic information (forthcoming by end of 2017); an improved traveler information interactive voice recognition (IVR) phone service in English; and a new IVR phone service in Spanish in 2018. The new Go511 mobile app, IVR, and SMS texting service will include real-time arrival information from all NextBus providers in the region.  The ability for BBB to include its information in Southern Californias new 511 in Spanish language is especially important, as 18.2% of BBB customers are monolingual Spanish speakers. Providing that the staff evaluation of the 511 solution meets customer needs, staff will develop the technical requirements to prepare a formal RFP to solicit proposals for the procurement of a real-time bus arrival information system that will be incorporated into BBBs suite of software products to improve customer experience. ", "background": "In 2013, Big Blue Bus explored the feasibility of making its transit data available in the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)-realtime format, which is software agnostic and comports with the Citys priority in transparency and open data. In 2014, BBB published its GTFS-realtime data, thereby allowing incorporation of its data into existing third-party trip-planning applications. This functionality allows BBB customers to use these apps to plan travel on BBB in real-time as opposed to static scheduled time. Making the real-time data publicly available did not address the void that existed for customers without smartphones or those who preferred to access information by phone or text message. In order to ensure that these customers would also benefit from real-time trip-planning, BBB sought to replicate the ability for customers to access real-time arrivals by phone and text message.  Vendor SelectionOn April 8, 2015, the City of Santa Monica entered into an agreement with NextBus, Inc. (NextBus) under SMMC 2.24.080(d) exception to the competitive procurement process, to provide real-time passenger information for BBB customers. NextBus, Inc. is a technology vendor that provides real-time information to customers by leveraging GPS technology and a proprietary algorithm that incorporates historical travel data to track transit vehicles and predict their arrival times. Big Blue Bus sought to make its bus arrival information available through NextBus because it had significant name recognition in the BBB service area, with clients such as Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Foothill Transit, and OmniTrans. The NextBus open Application Program Interface (API) standard had been available in the transit marketplace for many years and at the time the City entered into agreement with NextBus, 135 transit operators around the globe were utilizing NextBus real-time schedule information software. NextBus was a unique offering in the market, as they were the only vendor that offered a phone and text message feature and were willing to allow third-party integrations with a data format that is not region-specific. Providing real-time data in this ubiquitous format set NextBus apart without comparable substitutes, thereby, justifying the exception to the competitive process.

KIWA is contracted to provide support to Santa Monica workers and minority-owned or operated businesses, ROC-LA is contracted to provide outreach to Santa Monica restaurant workers, and Lee Andrews Group is contracted to provide outreach to Santa Monica business owners and managers.  Staff holds monthly discussions with each provider to discuss strategy and lessons learned, address questions or concerns, and review outreach efforts. Staff also encourages information sharing and collaboration among the groups to maximize effectiveness and mitigate against duplicative or conflicting efforts. Collectively, the organizations have provided direct support to nearly 1,000 Santa Monica businesses and over 800 workers. The organizations efforts complement the Citys communication efforts, which have helped to reach approximately 15,000 City business license holders and over 110,000 local workers and community members, as measured by social media impressions, website engagement, and minimum wage hotline calls. Staff will provide additional information to Council later in the year as part of the one-year review of minimum wage law implementation. All three contracts expire at the end of September 2017. Multi-year efforts to educate employees and businesses regarding minimum wages and associated requirements is a recognized best practice that other jurisdictions with similar minimum wage laws have employed. For example, the City and County of Los Angeles have similar agreements with these and comparable community-based groups. The initial feedback from Santa Monica businesses regarding the Citys minimum wage ordinance was that they had heard of the law but did not know the specific requirements or provisions. Santa Monica employees initially reported a limited general awareness of the law, though they knew very little of the laws specifics or its applicability to them. Feedback received throughout the year shows an increasing awareness among all parties, though information gaps still exist and could be narrowed by additional communication efforts.  Work with outreach groups is one part of the Citys outreach plan. City staff has concurrently implemented a series of communication and marketing efforts related to each milestone of the increase in the minimum wage and paid sick leave benefits, as well as producing a variety of collateral materials and public service announcements. Supplemental efforts to reach Santa Monica's minimum wage workers through posters on Big Blue Bus and Expo Light Rail have also helped raise overall awareness. The minimum wage law includes three additional annual increases in the hourly wage. The hotel living wage also increased significantly on July 1, 2017, to align with the City of Los Angeles. Ensuring that Santa Monica businesses are both aware of, and in full compliance with, the new law is extremely important. Providing educational outreach and multi-lingual support to Santa Monicas minimum wage workers is also critical in ensuring that workers know their rights under the new law and in overall efforts to help prevent wage-theft challenges.  Additional outreach support is also needed to continue to inform and educate both businesses and their employees of the paid sick-leave provisions of the law. Paid sick leave is a new labor law requirement and employee benefit in both Santa Monica and in the State of California. Many local workers continue to be unsure of or unaware of their entitled sick-leave benefits under the minimum wage law. Additional outreach to employers, paired with education materials to help them understand the legal requirements, helps ensure compliance. The Lee Andrews Group has been working closely with Economic Development, Finance, and the Office of Communications to develop outreach materials specific to the local minimum wage ordinance requirements. KIWA and ROC-LA are also exploring additional communication efforts, including videos and targeted social media, to help both workers and employers understand the minimum wage law and its requirements.  Staff recommends extending the contracts with all three firms for one year each, with two, one-year renewal options, in order to continue providing essential minimum wage ordinance education and outreach support to the community.

The City-sponsored Meet Me at Reed series of cultural programming has seen some success, helped in part by the July is Parks Month communication and outreach campaign.  Staff also reached out to other City departments and outside organizations to garner their interest in collaborating to activate Reed Park. A wide variety of programs have been implemented including special events, community class programs, as well as use of the park by Santa Monica YMCA, Santa Monica Boys and Girls Club, St. Monicas, Emeritus College, and other private organizations. Additionally, staff reached out to the current commercial fitness instructors to gauge their interest in using the park.

One HMST client had been chronically homeless in Santa Monica with numerous arrests and hospitalizations related to public intoxication. He had rejected traditional homeless outreach and mainstream services, due to the complexity of his physical and mental health and substance use disorder. HMST worked with City staff and the County Public Defenders Office to arrange an alternative sentencing option. The client completed a residential alcohol treatment program, was linked to a sober living program at CLARE Foundation, employment training at Chrysalis, and a permanent housing voucher through the regional Coordinated Entry System. This individual is now working a full-time job in Santa Monica, and is regularly engaged in activities to promote his sobriety, mental and physical health, and permanent housing. In the year prior to engaging with HMST, this individual was arrested by SMPD four times and transported by SMFD to local hospitals twice. Since participating in treatment with HMST, he has neither been arrested nor hospitalized. OPCC is tracking service and housing outcomes using the Citys Homeless Management Information System (HMIS), as well as engaging a third party evaluator to measure impact of services on clients wellbeing. The cohort will evolve over time. City staff have identified additional vulnerable individuals to be added to the HMST roster to replace those who have either died or the HMST have been unable to locate. The contract extension would allow for an assessment of step down interventions post-housing to determine how best to transition participants from HMST to other lower-intensity support services, thereby allowing the team to serve new individuals.  A forthcoming evaluation will examine cost avoidance and the effectiveness of this level of intervention. Consistent multi-year assessments are necessary to demonstrate the effects of social service interventions, the impacts of which are best measured by changes over time as illustrated by other evaluative tools such as The Wellbeing Index and the Youth Wellbeing Report Card.  RAND Corporation has approach the City with an offer to review the data collected by HMST, first responders and local hospitals, looking specifically at the effectiveness of the intervention for this highly vulnerable population and to see if the service model results in fewer contacts with local emergency services. RAND is offering this at no cost to the City. Staff recommends that the City enter into a professional services agreement with RAND for this work.  Should the evaluation of HMST confirm that this level of intervention is effective not only in placing vulnerable clients in housing but also reducing the impact on local emergency resources, the Community and Cultural Services Department may request an enhancement of the Human Services Grants Program (HSGP) budget to provide ongoing, sustainable funding for this program. The enhancement would be requested for the next four-year (FY 2019-23) HSGP funding cycle. Discussions are also underway to engage the business community to support this project as another ongoing source of partial funding. On October 25, 2016, as part of the Citys efforts to engage in regional solutions to homelessness, staff participated in a summit hosted by the Milken Institute. During the summit, discussions of technology solutions prompted a suggestion from City staff that providing first responders relevant information about homeless individuals in the field could improve their interactions and lead to safer, more productive outcomes than traditional enforcement alone. Representatives from the University of Southern California (USC)s Keck School of Medicine and the Milken Institute approached the City in March 2017 offering to develop a custom data sharing platform for first responders based on a similar health care data sharing system developed by Akido Labs, a software company built out of Keck Medicine. Around the same time, staff evaluated a similar product, GetRideALong.org, which was developed by a Code for America team for the Seattle Police Departments Crisis Response Team and gives officers key information about people with mental illness at the scene. RideaLong submitted a proposal for development of a custom software solution. Staff determined that RideALongs solution would have cost significantly more money and taken a much longer time to develop than the solution proposed by Akido.  Akido has proposed a three-phased approach to supporting data sharing and the coordination of care for homeless individuals who are frequently contacted by first responders. The first and second phases, which include discovery, development of data governance policies, and development, implementation, testing, and licensure of a pilot solution, would not result in a cost to the City. This work is expected to take approximately six months. The third phase of scaling, configuring, and implementing the software for multiple year use would take approximately four months. A one-time user-training fee of $5,000 would be charged at the end of FY17-18. Annual licensing and support would likely begin in early FY18-19 and would be charged based in part on needed support services. Service levels may vary over time as the solution is implemented. A service level agreement exhibit would be included in the contract. Additional services such as data analysis, design, development, and integration would be priced at $150/hour. Staff recommends entering into a four-year agreement with Akido not to exceed $85,000, with an option to extend the agreement by three additional years, as an exception to the competitive bidding process pursuant to Section 2.24.080 (d) given the proprietary nature of the product and its specify to Santa Monica. Staff have tested the theory that that real-time data sharing significantly improves the coordination of care for homeless individuals and have found it to be true; it is likely that this type of software will have long-standing applicability, therefore a term of up to seven years is proposed. Additionally, staff recommends entering into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Milken Institute and USCs Keck School of Medicine (KSOM) to memorialize the partnership, roles, and responsibilities. The Milken Institute will provide coordination, convening, and research support on a local, regional and state level in partnership with the members of the homelessness collaborative. USC KSOMs primary role will be to document, research, write and develop case studies for the projects. The City of Santa Monicas primary role will be to support research, development, deployment and evaluation of technology based projects.  ", "background": "On August 23, 2015 (Attachment A), the City Council convened a special Council meeting and identified the Citys five top priority Strategic Goals including taking a leadership role in regional efforts to address homelessness.   On October 27, 2015 (Attachment B), staff recommended appropriating $5.1 million of one-time General Fund savings for projects that will produce measurable results in support of Councils Strategic Goals.

This team builds upon the successful assertive case management model utilized by the Chronic Homeless Project (CHP) and the comprehensive medical and behavioral health approach used by the Integrated Mobile Health Team (IMHT) to address the changing characteristics of the homeless community in the City.  On February 12, 2016, the City issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a Homeless Multidisciplinary Street Team. The RFP was posted on the Citys online bidding system in accordance with the City Charter and Municipal Code provisions. One proposal, from the non-profit agency OPCC, was received and reviewed by staff from the Human Services Division (HSD), the Police Department, the Fire Department, and the Library.

The AHPP was adopted by the City Council on July 21, 1998 (Attachment D) and has been periodically amended, as necessary. The AHPP requires developers of new market-rate, multi-family housing to contribute to affordable housing goals by designating a portion of a developments total residences as affordable housing, constructing affordable housing off site, designating land for affordable housing development, or paying an affordable housing fee. The affordable housing fee is updated annually based upon changes in land and construction costs. Multi-family project applicants with less than three units in a multi-family residential district and all multi-family project applicants in commercial districts may pay the affordable housing fee based upon the Affordable Housing Unit Base Fee multiplied by the floor area of the development.  When a developer chooses to designate a portion of a projects total residences as affordable housing, the number of affordable residences that must be provided is based on the number of market-rate units in the development. Often, the calculation of required affordable residences results in a fraction. In such instances, when the fraction is 0.75 or more, the number is rounded-up to a whole number. However, any fraction less than 0.75 may be satisfied by payment of a fee based upon the Affordable Housing Unit Development Cost, which is also automatically adjusted annually based upon changes in land and construction costs. For example, if a developer is required to provide 4.7 units of affordable housing within a development, the developer would be required to designate four affordable units and pay 0.7 times the Affordable Housing Unit Development Cost to satisfy the requirement associated with the fraction. Annual Fee AdjustmentsSection 9.64.070 of the Citys AHPP provides that the Affordable Housing Unit Base Fee and the Affordable Housing Unit Development Cost shall be adjusted annually by Council resolution based on changes in construction and land costs. The fee adjustment methodology is detailed in Section 2 of the AHPP Administrative Guidelines (Attachment E) and reflects the methodology approved by Council in 2006.

For FY 2017-18, staff estimates the Airport will produce $12.2M in rental revenue by eliminating master tenants Gunnell Properties, American Flyers, Krueger Aviation, partial elimination of Atlantic Aviation as a master tenant, and raising rents to reflect market rates.  There are three leftover master tenants subleasing a mix of facilities at Santa Monica Airport. A master tenant is considered a landlord of subtenants, meaning that a master tenant is able to evict a subtenant, collect rent, set terms, etc. The three master tenants at Santa Monica Airport combined have approximately 147 subtenants. Below is a breakdown of the master tenants and their sub-tenants: As directed by Council in March 2016, staff continues to eliminate all master tenancies in a fair and reasonable manner for an orderly transition and to ensure the City has the property management capacity required to assume the responsibilities. Of the three remaining master tenants only Atlantic Aviation is an aviation master tenant. Staff intends to phase out the remaining master tenants during FY 2017-18. An orderly transition provides the City the time needed to build the management capacity required to assume the added responsibilities.  Staff believes leasing revenues at the Airport will increase, albeit at a much slower pace than over the last two years, during FY 17-18 due to several on-going lease negotiations. For instance, assuming Atlantic Aviation and the City agree to terms on a three-year lease for its facility per the Consent Decree, staff anticipates the City will realize greater revenue from the premises occupied by Atlantic Aviation for two reasons. First, Atlantic Aviations rent is likely to be adjusted upward to reflect market rates and second the City will be transitioning Atlantics sub-tenants into direct tenants of the City. In addition to lease negotiations with Atlantic Aviation, the City is or soon will be in lease negotiations with Santa Monica College and Santa Monica Air Center. Santa Monica Art Studios will also be renegotiated and the new terms may lead to an increase in future revenues. As forecast in March 2016, staff report, having the City take over as a direct landlord has increased real estate brokerage fees, property management fees, and capital expenditures. In response to the increase in property management responsibilities and real estate brokerage duties, the City hired Aeroplex Property Management and Commercial Management Group following the competitive bidding process. In FY 2017-18, staff has budgeted $500,000 to cover property management fees and real estate brokerage fees. Expenditures for capital improvements, repairs, maintenance and replacement now, and will into the foreseeable future, consume significant capital due to the poor condition of the facilities formerly managed by the above master tenants. In order to determine the magnitude of the problem, staff intends to perform a comprehensive facilities condition assessment (FCA) in FY 17-18. The runway shortening project will also require significant funding. With proper management, vigilant oversight, and prudent fiscal restraint, staff is confident the Airport will be able to maintain aviation facilities up to standard, repay its debt, and maintain a safe airport, until it closes in 2028. Staff identifies three possible alternatives:1.     The City Council may consider not adopting the proposed Leasing Policy. If the new amended policy is not adopted, the City Manager would be prohibited from offering leases beyond June 30, 2018.2.     The City Council may consider amending the Leasing Policy as it deems appropriate.3.     The City Council may consider returning the Leasing Policy to the Airport Commission, if necessary, and as appropriate, for additional input.. At its August 1, 2017 special meeting, the Airport Commission voted to recommend that City Council adopt the Airport Leasing Policy as presented to the Airport Commission.", "background": "Airport lands are divided into two categories: aviation and non-aviation. The Santa Monica Airport has 187 acres designated and used for aviation activities and 40 acres designated and used for non-aviation purposes. As of July 1, 2017, there are 383tenants at the Airport. This includes a combination of offices, hangars, storage, land leases, and tie-down tenant. There are approximately 60 vacant leasable spaces.  Lease and license revenues account for approximately 70% of total annual Airport revenues. The revenue derived from Airport leasing supports the Citys goals of achieving a financially self-sufficient airport, eliminating subsidies from the General Fund, and repaying the principal and interest of past General Fund subsidies. In the past, the Airport's operation, maintenance, and capital expenditures were subsidized by the General Fund. As of June 30, 2017, the Airport has a debt obligation to the General Fund of over $10M. Since FY 2013-14, the Airport Fund has no longer required an operating subsidy from the General Fund.  On March 22, 2016, the City Council adopted an Airport Leasing and Licensing Policy (Attachment A). Over the last 16 months, the Policy provided staff critical guidance used to position the Airport into a much stronger financial condition.  On January 28, 2017, the City of Santa Monica and the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the Federal Aviation Administration, signed a settlement agreement regarding the airport. On February 1st, U.S. Judge Walters approved the settlement agreement thereby converting it into a Consent Decree (Attachment B). The Consent Decree imposes two obligations that are relevant to leasing policy. First, the Consent Decree requires the City to offer aeronautical service providers, such as Atlantic Aviation and Kim Davidson Aviation, three-year lease terms based on market rates. Aeronautical service providers offer a range of services, including flight schools, fueling, maintenance, etc. The Consent Decree also obligates the City to adhere to FAA grant assurance 22. FAA grant assurance 22 requires airport sponsor/owners to lease to aviation users based on reasonable commercial terms.  ", "summary": "On March 22, 2016, the City Council adopted an Airport Leasing and Licensing Policy (Attachment A). Over the past year and a half, the Policy provided staff critical guidance for pursuing the Councils Strategic Goal of regaining local land use control over the property presently occupied by the Santa Monica Airport. Moreover, the existing Leasing Policy has been a financial success. As a direct consequence of the Councils decision to adopt the Airport Leasing Policy, the Airport is positioned to repay the millions owed the City, repair and maintain facilities, and achieve long-term financial self-sufficiency until it closes in 2028. Specifically, the Councils decision to terminate master tenants and charge market rates have produced a significantly increased revenue stream. Staff is recommending changes in the Leasing Policy that reflect changed circumstances due to the Consent Decree with the Federal Government: Terms:         Term for Aeronautical Service Providers. As stipulated by the Consent Decree aeronautical service providers must be offered three-year lease terms.          Term for Non-Aviation Tenants. Lease terms may be month-to-month or longer. However, no lease shall have a term that goes beyond December 31, 2028.  Lease Approvals & Delegation of Authority          The existing Policy grants the City Manager the authority to negotiate and execute leases with terms ending no later than June 30, 2018. The proposed policy would extend the same authority to the City Manager for leases terminating on or before December 31, 2022.  The Airport Commission has voted to support these changes."}, "title": " Santa Monica Airport Leasing and Licensing Policy", "Sponsors": null, "recommendations": ["     Approve the attached Santa Monica Airport Leasing and Licensing Policy for the leasehold and license management of properties at the Santa Monica Airport (Airport or SMO).", "     Authorize the City Manager to negotiate and execute leases at the Santa Monica Airport in accordance with this Policy."], "Department": "City Manager's Office, Administration"}, {"Category": "03.

With direction from City Council to continue Santa Monicas commitment to competitive compensation for our workforce while keeping costs within the Citys Five Year financial forecast, the City and the groups have met and conferred in accordance with the Meyers-Millias Brown Act (MMBA). These negotiations resulted in previous public ratification of agreements covering sworn Police Officers, the Executive Pay Plan and benefits for non-sworn City workers. Negotiations have continued for a successor to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the City and the Administrative Team Associates (ATA), Municipal Employees Association (MEA), the Public Attorneys Union (PAU), the Santa Monica Firefighters Local 1109 IAFF, Supervisory Team Association (STA), the Management Team Associates (MTA) and the Confidential Unrepresented Employees (CUE) pay plan that have now resulted in tentative agreements. The terms of the tentative agreements are summarized below. In general, they seek to contain the cost of net annual salary increases within the most recent annual rise in the cost of living of 1.7%; to minimize increases in pension obligations; and seek trade-offs that equitably share the rising costs of pension and medical benefits between the City and employees. The purpose of the Memorandum of Understanding is to promote and provide harmonious relations, cooperation, and understanding between the City and the various bargaining units. The total cost of the negotiated changes is approximately $2,842,088 for FY 2017-18. The budget impact of these changes was included in the General Fund FY 2017-18 through FY 2021-22 Five-Year Financial Forecast.   On June 27, 2017, Council approved agreements with the Executive Pay Plan (EPP) and set the terms and conditions for medical insurance for most City employees (Attachment A). On July 11, 2017, Council approved the terms for the agreements with the Police Officers Association (POA) (Attachment B) The MOU's with Administrative Team Associates (ATA), Municipal Employees Association (MEA), the Public Attorneys Union (PAU), the Santa Monica Firefighters Local 1109 IAFF, Supervisory Team Association (STA), the Management Team Associates (MTA) and the Confidential Unrepresented Employees (CUE) pay plan expired June 30, 2017. Per the terms and conditions of the MOUs, negotiations with ATA, MEA, MTA, STA, Local 1109 and the PAU for successor MOUs have resulted in tentative agreements on the terms for new MOUs. The CUE Pay Plan establishes the salary, benefit and additional terms and conditions of employment for employees in classifications not represented by a bargaining unit, covered by the EPP, or covered by separate employment agreements. The City Council approved resolutions for the City Manager to execute the current MOUs between the 2014-2016 fiscal years.  The overall policy of the City of Santa Monica has been to maintain competitive wages, hours, and working conditions in a high-cost geographic labor market in order to retain and attract a dedicated, high-quality workforce to serve our community across a wide range of specialized services.  Since most, though not all, City jobs are comparable to those in other municipalities, the City has traditionally looked to full-service cities in our region of similar size and financial strength for labor market comparisons. Market competitiveness in recruitment, the increase in the Consumer Price Index, internal equity, and offsetting contributions to pension and medical benefits may also be factors that contribute to the setting of compensation during the negotiations process. Generally, the City finds itself in first or second position among comparable cities. As a result, the City has maintained competitiveness through modest cost of living adjustments. The Council is undertaking a compensation review overseen by the City Council Audit Subcommittee that will provide a comprehensive analysis for future policy direction.Tentative agreements with the majority of the remaining bargaining units are as described below. Negotiations with three groups still remain and agreements are expected to be forthcoming.  The substantive terms of the tentative agreements are summarized for each bargaining unit or group below. Various groups have negotiated for increased vacation cash-out provisions and all have non-substantive language revisions. Administrative Team Associates The substantive terms of the tentative agreements are summarized as follows:         The three-year agreement between the City of Santa Monica and the ATA is effective July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2020.         ATA employees will earn a total of 4.7% salary increase over three years and the City will begin contributing to a 401(a) account, with a total contribution of $100 per month at the end of the three-year contract. Contributions to deferred compensation do not increase the Citys unfunded pension liabilities while still providing a competitive benefit to staff.          The City and ATA have agreed to delay the implementation of the second and third year salary increases to January of 2019 and January of 2020, respectively, which offsets the costs of the deferred compensation over the course of the contract. Supervisory Team Associates The substantive terms of the tentative agreements are summarized as follows:         The three-year agreement between the City of Santa Monica and the STA is effective July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2020.         STA employees will earn a total of a 4.7% salary increase over the three year term of the contract and the City will begin contributing to a 457 deferred compensation account, with a total contribution of $84 per month at by the end of the three-year contract. Deferred compensation contributions have no financial impact on the Citys unfunded CalPERS pension liabilities.         The City and STA have agreed to delay the implementation of the second and third year salary increases to January of 2019 and January of 2020, respectively, which offsets the costs of the deferred compensation over the course of the contract. SM Firefighters Local 1109The substantive terms of the tentative agreements are summarized as follows:         The three-year agreement between the City of Santa Monica and Local 1109 is effective July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2020.         There is no across the board salary increase during the first year of the agreement but it does include an equity adjustment for the classification of Battalion Chief and Fire Marshal which will assist in maintaining appropriate differentials between promotional ranks. The agreement also includes the implementation of a Longevity Bonus, effective August 1, 2017. There are two levels of the longevity bonus; at 10 years of a service, employees earn a 5% bonus and upon 20 years of service, employees earn a 10% bonus.          The second and third years of the agreement each include a 2.5% salary increase and an additional 1% each year in contributions toward retirement benefits. By the third year of the agreement, Local 1109 members will be paying a total of 15% towards retirement benefits and an additional 3% (11% total) toward their medical premiums. This will assist in continuing to offset the rising payroll costs of the City.         The City will contribute $90 per month to a 457 deferred compensation account, effective August 1, 2017. Again, this is a benefit that does not add to the Citys pension liabilities with CalPERS.          The agreement also includes the establishment of the Firefighter-Paramedic classification. This modification to the staffing structure ensures that the Fire department can continue to meet the high service levels of the community and will over time assist with reducing costs.   Municipal Employees AssociationThe substantive terms of the tentative agreements are summarized as follows:         The two-year agreement between the City of Santa Monica and the MEA is effective July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019.         MEA employees will earn a total of a 3.2% salary increase over the two years of the contract. The City will increase the matching contribution to a 457 deferred compensation account by $12.50 per month, for a total match of $62.50 per month. This increase in matching contribution to a 457 deferred compensation has no impact on the unfunded pension liability but increases the opportunity for staff to contribute to their retirement savings. Management Team AssociatesThe substantive terms of the tentative agreements are summarized as follows:         The three-year agreement between the City of Santa Monica and the MTA is effective July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2020.          MTA employees will earn a total of a 4.7% salary increase over the three year contract. The City and MTA have agreed to delay the implementation of the second and third year salary increases to January of 2019 and January of 2020, respectively, which assists in offsetting the cost of a deferred compensation contribution during the term of the contract.         The City will begin contributing $68 per month to a 457 deferred compensation account in the third year of the agreement.         MTA employees will receive two management leave days, of which one is cashable, which will bring them more in line with other management and supervisory bargaining units. Public Attorneys Union         The substantive terms of the tentative agreements are summarized as follows:         The three-year agreement between the City of Santa Monica and the PAU is effective July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2020.          PAU employees will earn a total of a 4.5% salary increase over the three year contract. PAU employees will also receive five non-cashable leave days which brings this group in line with other professional bargaining units. Confidential Unrepresented EmployeesWhile there is no contract expiration for the CUE pay plan, this resolution would set salaries for CUE employees for a one-year period through June 30, 2018. Benefits and privileges as set forth in the MOUs between the City and the bargaining unit to which the confidential unrepresented classifications are aligned. The attached resolution accepts the tentative MOU agreements and CUE pay plan and authorizes the City Manager to execute the MOUs.  "}, "title": " Resolution Authorizing the City Manager to Execute Memoranda of Understanding with the Administrative Team Associates (ATA), Municipal Employees Association (MEA), the Public Attorneys Union (PAU),  the Santa Monica Firefighters Local 1109 IAFF, Supervisory Team Association (STA), the Management Team Associates (MTA), and Confidential Unrepresented Employees (CUE) pay plan.", "Sponsors": null, "recommendations": ["", " Adopt the attached Resolution authorizing the City Manager to execute a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the City of Santa Monica and the Administrative Team Associates (ATA), Municipal Employees Association (MEA), the Public Attorneys Union (PAU), the Santa Monica Firefighters Local 1109 IAFF, Supervisory Team Association (STA), the Management Team Associates (MTA), and the Confidential Unrepresented Employees (CUE) pay plan.", " Approve the attached revised salary schedule effective as a result of the agreement reached for the classifications represented by the Administrative Team Associates (ATA), Municipal Employees Association (MEA), the Public Attorneys Union (PAU), the Santa Monica Firefighters Local 1109 IAFF, Supervisory Team Association (STA), the Management Team Associates (MTA), and the Confidential Unrepresented Employees (CUE) pay plan.", ""], "Department": "Human Resources Department"}, {"Category": "03.

The mobile stroke unit team is comprised of a Stroke Neurologist, Critical Care Nurse, CT Technician, and a Santa Monica Fire Department Paramedic.  Definitive treatments for acute stroke can only be started after a brain CT is done and shows the type of stroke suffered. Mobile stroke units bring the hospital to the patient allowing for timely treatment as time is brain. Treatment can be started 30-60 minutes faster resulting in substantially improved patient outcomes.  A mobile stroke unit carries a CT scanner on board so that, once its identified a patient with clinical signs of an acute ischemic stroke in the field and confirms that the timing of the stroke onset suggests eligibility for tPA treatment, a CT scan can immediately be run on site to finalize tPA eligibility. The mobile stroke unit staff can then begin infusing the drug in the ambulance on the way directly to a comprehensive stroke center.  In 2011, the worlds first active mobile stroke unit was deployed in Germany. Since then, mobile stroke units have expanded across the globe. While there are 14 mobile stroke units operating with positive results in states across the United States, no mobile stroke unit is yet operating in the State of California.  UCLA and the City of Santa Monica Fire Department will be collaborating to implement the first mobile stroke unit in California. Not only will this be the first mobile stroke unit in the state but thanks to the generous support of Arline and Henry Gluck, it will be the first in the nation to be supported by a public-private partnership. The County Board of Supervisors motion directs $1.46 million to expand the mobile stroke unit pilot program run by UCLA Health. The funding comes from the County of Los Angeles Measure B, a parcel tax funding source dedicated to supporting emergency and trauma services. Early data collected shows that initiating care of an acute ischemic stroke patient in a mobile stroke unit shaves precious minutes off the time it takes to start thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) compared with that at a hospital, and findings from preliminary analyses suggest better functional outcomes for these patients. ", "summary": "On June 20, 2017, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted to fund a mobile stroke unit pilot program in Los Angeles County.

This pilot would deploy a dedicated specialized ambulance provided by UCLA and a medical team devoted to treating stroke patients. The pilot will take place over a two-year period, with a potential one-year extension, to evaluate the effectiveness in reducing deaths and disability caused by stroke. The SMFD has agreed to participate pending Council approval. SMFD has a long-standing relationship with UCLA and the department has a history of implementing innovative programs.

Administrative Item", "body": {"other": "Santa Monicas City Hall was originally constructed in 1939 and the building serves as an outstanding example of the Moderne style of architecture, popular throughout LosAngeles in the 1930s. City Hall is listed in the California Register of Historic Resources and as a Santa Monica Historic Landmark. City Hall was built during a time when the citys population was roughly half its current size and virtually the entire City workforce was housed in one building. The Citys population and scope of local municipal services have expanded significantly in the intervening three-quarters of a century. Since adoption in 2005 of an updated Civic Center Specific Plan, it has been a planned vision to create a more cohesive Civic Campus that better serves the public and centralizes staff. A City Services Building has long been planned to be constructed immediately adjacent to City Hall. The new building would be approximately 50,000 square feet, including three stories plus a basement and 45 feet above grade.  The City Services Building Project (CSB) would result in substantial future savings by eliminating numerous leased office spaces for approximately 240 City staff and would realize the vision for a centralized Civic Campus. The CSB would bring departments and vital public counter functions under one roof to streamline services into a one-stop location. By creating a consolidated workplace, staffs ability to collaborate would improve along with staffs increased efficiency and productivity to serve the community. Today municipal operations are spread throughout Santa Monica, but in the future there would be only two hubs of operation: the City Hall Civic Campus and City Yards.  The proposed buildings design is subtle and intended to accent City Halls eastern edge in a quiet emerging manner that will reflect and respect City Hall. Approvals by the Planning Commission and the Landmarks Commission have been received for the project.  The new buildings ground floor was thoughtfully designed to achieve an improved public experience. The design incorporates advanced acoustics and thermal comfort for the health and wellbeing of its visitors and occupants. City services consolidated in the space to serve the public in one location include finance, utilities, parking, plan check, permits and civil land development. The CSB design would also address critical utilities upgrades and routing that feed City Hall, the Public Safety Facility and the new building. The CSB would serve as an essential services building, which means it would be fully operational during emergencies and disasters.  The City anticipates using annual lease savings to offset the cost of the lease revenue bonds that would be issued to pay for the CSB. Annual lease savings would meet and exceed the annual costs of debt service during the 30-year financing term. The CSB is designed to meet Living Building Challenge certification and would be a net zero energy and net zero water building. The design would address the realities of climate change and drought, and its success would demonstrate to the region and the world what is possible by regenerative building design and construction.  The CSB would fulfill multifaceted community goals and CCSP goals by:          Being designed sensitively in context to the historic and landmarked City Hall, and accomplishing improvements to the Civic Core as intended by the Civic Center Specific Plan         Integrating more public counter services into the City Hall location and improving the overall customer and community experience         Advancing the Councils sustainability commitment as worldwide environmental leaders by providing a model of sustainable design and construction         Providing taxpayer savings over its 100-year useful lifespan by eliminating expensive office space lease agreements, incurring zero utility fees which result in long-term net savings, and providing a net positive environmental benefit by harvesting its own energy and water onsite The bond amount of $76,760,000 million, which is also before the Council for approval, would be used to fund the CSB. The detailed breakdown of costs related is explained below in Table 1. The updated cost of the City Services Building has been revised from previous estimates to include $760,000 for the City-mandated allocation to the Percent for Art program, and $1,195,251 in additional contingency reflecting available bond proceeds. Table 1: Cost Breakdown for City Services Building Project in the Civic Campus Program.  Feasibility Study 4/8/2014$ 258,000*Design-Build: Design Services4/28/2015$ 7,064,501*Design-Build Amendment 1: Additional Design Services11/1/2016$ 381,729*Design-Build Amendment 2: Construction GMP (CSB)8/8/2017$ 61,243,526Direct Owner CostsVarious$ 7,052,244*Percent For ArtTBD$ 760,000 * Funding previously allocated. Only $772,000 of Direct Owner Costs were previously allocated. Hathaway Dinwiddie contract includes $1,910,750 for City Hall improvements not included in the total CSB project cost.  AlternativesMembers of the community have suggested that, as an alternative to constructing the City Services Building behind City Hall, the City consider purchasing the historic Post Office Building at 1248 Fifth Street and build it out to accommodate City staff currently occupying leased office space. Based on the Citys preliminary evaluation, this option is not feasible. Below is a comparison of the two projects:    Current floor area33,000 sq. ft.N/AEntitled build out size: 48,458 sq. ft.50,200 sq. ft.Total occupants at build out: 54240 The Post Office Building is a registered historic landmark with requirements that limit how it may be developed. It includes the main floor and a basement level that total approximately 33,000 square feet. The main lobby of the building, which is approximately 3,500 sq. ft., is a historically significant component of the building that cannot be significantly altered, limiting the amount of usable current floor area to under 30,000 sq. ft. The current entitlements would allow for an additional 15,000 sq. ft. bringing the total usable floor area to approximately 45,000 sq. ft. at build out. In order to design usable office space in the basement level, significant modifications would need to be made to allow access to natural light, which would likely further limit the available floor area of the building. As currently permitted, the building is designed to house 54 people and would have 25 onsite parking spaces upon completion. The cost for the City to purchase the Post Office Building is currently unknown. The building was purchased for $25 million in 2013. With the current entitlements and increases in property value over the past 4 years, it is estimated that the purchase price would exceed $30 million today.  The planned City Services Building adjacent to City Hall is a 50,200 sq. ft. building that would house City staff who currently occupy leased space in several buildings in various locations in Santa Monica. In total, the new building would accommodate 240 City staff. The project is intended to centralize City functions in one location to significantly improve convenience, efficiency and customer service. The building would be funded using lease revenue bonds, which would be paid using the funds currently allocated to pay for leased office space. However, the amount of funding available would be based on the number of employees that could be relocated from current leased space to the new location. Additionally, the funds invested to date of close to $10M would be lost and would also need to be considered in the total costs of an alternative project. It is very unlikely that the Post Office Building could accommodate 240 City staff at full build out, due to the smaller total usable floor space. There are significant restrictions on modifications made to buildings with landmark status that would generate significant challenges. Even under the best of circumstances, the separated lobby and the basement condition at the Post Office Building would make it difficult to create conditions that would accommodate all of the relocated City staff. The existing permitted plans allow for just 54 occupants. In order to increase that number to allow for even 100 occupants the entire space would need to be redesigned and new permits would need to be obtained, which would add to the cost of the project. In comparison, the CSB design can accommodate 240 staff because it is an open plan design with natural light and ventilation and would be built to maximize the efficient use of space.  The cost to complete a full redesign and construction of the Post Office Building has not been evaluated because the constraints on the site and the Citys ability to fund its purchase and construction, as noted above, make it clear that it is not a feasible option to replace the City Services Building project. To summarize, not all City staff currently in leased office space could be adequately housed in the Post Office Building, requiring the City to continue leasing space for some functions. It would not centralize currently disparate City functions in one location because some of those functions would have to remain at City Hall and others in leased space. The small amount of parking on the site after build out would require City staff to park in other locations in the downtown, impacting the parking supply in the area. This represents an expensive option that would maintain the current status quo with regard to location of City staff and inefficient service delivery to the public. As such, it would not provide benefits to the community through a central Civic Campus improving customer service, operational efficiency and cost savings that would be achieved by proceeding with the City Services Building project as currently proposed. Consultant Selection - Construction ManagementOn June 2, 2017, the City issued a Request for Proposals RFP #SP2250 to provide construction management services for the City Services Building Project. The RFP was posted on the Citys online bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with the City Charter and Municipal Code provisions. A total of 50 vendors downloaded the RFP. The City received and publicly opened seven proposals on June 14, 2017. Responses to the RFP were reviewed by a selection panel of staff from the Public Works Department. List of proposals received:          Cumming         Griffin Structures         PMCS Group, Inc.          Arcadis         GKK Works         Vanir         Civil Source Evaluation was based on the following selection criteria: technical competence, staffing capability, project approach and planning, past performance, dispute resolution, quality control, cost control, customer service, and the cost of services. Based on this criteria and criteria in SMMC 2.24.073, staff recommends GKK Works as the best qualified firm to provide construction management services for the City Services Building Project. The GKK Works team has extensive knowledge and experience on numerous design-build construction projects involving new municipal building construction. They have also successfully managed projects that included essential services buildings, net zero energy programs, and complex water systems requiring close coordination with the Regional Water Quality Control Board and the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.  Next StepsUpon Council approval of the GMP for construction and issuance of the lease-revenue bonds, staff anticipates the following project timeline: Site preparation and utility relocation work - September 2017 Start of full construction work - January 2018 Complete construction - April 2020 ", "background": "On March 27, 2012 (Attachment A), Council authorized staff to seek proposals for the feasibility, initial design and cost estimates for a City Services Building located on the selected site east of City Hall. On October 8, 2013 (Attachment B), staff issued an Information Item detailing the proposed design-build delivery method for the design and construction of the City Services Building. This approach offered phased implementation, starting with a feasibility analysis, concept design and cost estimation, and an integrated project team of builders, designers and specialty consultants to provide expertise throughout the entire project delivery timeline.  On April 8, 2014 (Attachment C), Council authorized the City Manager to negotiate and execute a professional services agreement with Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company for the feasibility analysis, concept design and cost estimates for the City Services Building Project. This agreement was the first of three phases in the design-build process.  On January 27, 2015 (Attachment D), Council reviewed a feasibility report on the City Services Building Project and authorized the City Manager to negotiate a Guaranteed Maximum Price with design-build contractor Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company for design services including Living Building Challenge certification. On April 28, 2015 (Attachment E), Council authorized the City Manager to execute a contract with Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company for design services for the City Services Building Project in an amount not to exceed $7,064,501. This agreement was the second of three phases in the design-build process.  On May 24, 2016 (Attachment F), Council reviewed and commented on the schematic design and cost estimates for the City Services Building, and directed staff to proceed with design development. On November 1, 2016 (Attachment G), Council authorized the City Manager to negotiate and execute a first contract modification to Agreement #10051 (CCS) with Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company to incorporate additional design services in an amended Guaranteed Maximum Price for design with a new total amount not to exceed $8,756,981. Staff expanded design services to include adjustments to the City Services Building program, provide technical design services to move the Citys Traffic Management Center to the building, modify the courtyard circulation, design additional environmental systems for the pasteurization of waste materials produced in the building and to provide an additional CEQA historic resources technical report for the project. Additionally, staff increased the design-build scope of work to include a tenant improvement project in the South Wing of City Hall to be done after completion of the City Services Building construction, and to design the essential fire and life safety alterations in City Hall as required by code officials. On January 24, 2017 (Attachment H), Council reviewed the Civic Center Specific Plan EIR Sixth Addendum with the Final EIR and adopted a resolution to amend the Civic Center Specific Plan to account for the relocation of the City Services Building to the rear of the Santa Monica City Hall. ", "summary": "The City Services Building (CSB) Project brings nearly all core municipal operations onto one City Hall campus as envisioned in the Civic Center Specific Plan. The investment in this new building meets three main objectives: Offers a one-stop hub to better serve the community. The CSB would bring departments and vital public counter functions under one roof to streamline services in one location.  Eliminates all existing city office space leases and consolidates municipal operations onto city-owned land. City Hall was constructed in 1938 and in 79 years, the services that the City provides to the community has expanded and outgrown the historic building. For several decades, city divisions have been spread throughout the downtown, leasing space. With the construction of the City Services Building, the City will eliminate leases saving as much as $10 million annually and bring 240 staff under one roof.  Achieves a strong return on investment for the City both economically and environmentally with a resource efficient structure. The building is a long term investment that is designed to streamline operational functionality and to be resource efficient. It is a Living Building and will not have a water or electric bill because it will produce the energy and water it consumes on site.  The total cost of the City Services Building Project is anticipated to be $76,760,000. Staff proposes to fund the City Services Building Project using $76,760,000 million in bond proceeds as proposed in Item 9A of tonights Council Meeting agenda. The detailed breakdown of costs related to the CSB is explained in Table 1 of this report. The GMP Amendment 2 to Design-Build Contract No. 10051 (CCS) for construction services with Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company would be the final of a three phased design-build approach for the City Services Building Project: Phase I:   Feasibility analysis, concept design and cost estimatesPhase II:  Design services including schematic design, design development, construction documents, project management, and cost estimatingPhase III:  Construction services including construction administration  Staff recommends executing the GMP Amendment 2 for City Services Building construction with Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company in the amount of $61,843,526 (includes 2.4% contingency) for a total contract amount not to exceed $70,600,507. The total contract amount includes $1,310,750 for previously authorized design services and $600,000 in newly requested construction services for City Hall improvements.

Public Hearings", "body": {"other": "Staff is recommending that the City issue lease revenue bonds in the amount of $76.76 million to fund the City Services Building project. When determining whether to issue bonds to cover this capital cost, the City has considered a number of factors. First, the Citys adopted financial policies assert the prudence of using debt financing to distribute the cost of a facility over its useful life. Also, owing to its sound financial health and resulting high credit ratings, the City is able to benefit from low-cost financing. This allows for greater flexibility in allocating existing resources. Finally, the City is able to take advantage of favorable conditions in the municipal bond market due to its very low level of debt. With regard to the last factor, the Citys indebtedness is limited by Article VI of the City Charter, which states that the bonded indebtedness of the City may not exceed the sum of 10% of the total assessed valuation of property within the City. With this bond issuance, staff estimates that this indicator would reach 0.44%. A breakdown of the total costs of the project is shown in the table below.Feasibility Study 4/8/2014 $ 258,000* Design-Build: Design Services4/28/2015 $ 7,064,501*Design-Build Amendment 1: Additional Design Services11/1/2016 $ 381,729* Design-Build Amendment 2: Construction GMP (CSB)8/8/2017 $ 61,243,526Direct Owner Costs*Various $ 7,052,244 *Percent For ArtTBD $ 760,000 Total Cost * Funding previously allocated. Only $772,000 of Direct Owner Costs were previously allocated.Hathaway Dinwiddie contract includes $1,910,750 for City Hall improvements not included in the total CSB project cost.  A portion of the bond proceeds will be used to reimburse the General Fund for previous feasibility study, design services appropriations and direct owner costs. The bonds would be secured by a lease agreement between the City as lessee and the Santa Monica Public Financing Authority (PFA) as lessor.  The lease agreement is based on use of City Hall and the Citys Main Library during City Services Building construction. Once the City Services Building is completed and occupied by the City, expected in 2020, the Main Library and City Hall will be removed from security for the lease and payments will be solely for City Services Building use and occupancy. This arrangement means that the City will not need to include interest due on the bonds during construction in the bond amount (capitalized interest). Due to the high environmental standards associated with the design of the City Services Building, staff recommends that the Series 2017 Bonds carry the designation of Green Bonds. This designation is a signal to bond investors who may have a preference for investing in projects that promote climate change mitigation and meet other environmental objectives. Staff recommends a negotiated bond sale whereby the bond underwriter is predetermined and the Bond interest rates are set through a process of negotiation. A negotiated sale, as compared to an open competitive bid, is the best way to ensure the bond underwriter is in compliance with the Citys recent banking services Resolution (Resolution No. 11025 City Council Series-adopted February 28, 2017). Upon Council approval of the Series 2017 Bond issuance, the Citys financial advisor will assist staff in determining the fair market value for the Bond interest rates and issuance of the bonds. To select a bond underwriter, the Citys financial advisor distributed a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) to 18 commercial and investment banking institutions active in the California tax-exempt bond market. The RFQ required respondents to certify the firm was in compliance with the Citys recent banking services resolution. Fourteen firms responded to the RFQ. The financial advisor rated the firms based on a combination of factors including their recommended approach to the bond sale, relevant experience with similar financings, methodology to execute the bond sale, compensation, and compliance with City social responsibility guidelines per Resolution 11025. The recommendations were then presented to Finance Department staff who made the final selection of Morgan Stanley as lead manager, and Fidelity Capital Markets and Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. as co-managers. In preparation for issuance of the bonds, credit ratings were requested from three credit rating agencies that currently maintain credit ratings on the City and Authority bonds. The credit rating agencies  Fitch Ratings, Moodys Investors Service, and Standard & Poors  each assigned their highest possible lease revenue bond ratings to the bonds (AA+, Aa1, and AA+, respectively) and affirmed the Citys AAA/Aaa/AAA general obligation bond credit ratings.The attached resolutions and documents permit the City and PFA to proceed with all steps necessary to issue the Series 2017 Bonds.  The resolutions approve the attached documents and authorize their execution and delivery by the specified agencys officials and employees.  The resolutions also approve the preparation, execution, and delivery of a Final Official Statement; the execution and delivery of any additional documents and certificates; and the performance of such acts or related actions as may be necessary or desirable to effect the offering, sale, and issuance of the Series 2017 Bonds.  The Resolutions authorize the PFA to issue Series 2017 Bonds with a maximum principal amount of $76,760,000, with a final maturity date of July 1, 2047 and a maximum true interest cost of 5.00%. This August 8, 2017 meeting serves as a public hearing relating to the public benefits of financing the City Services Building improvements through the PFA. Staff published this public hearing notice in the Santa Monica Daily Press on August 1, 2017; at least five days prior to the hearing date as the Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement (JPA) law requires. Approving the recommended actions will result in the PFA issuing up to $76,760,000 in tax-exempt Lease Revenue Bonds. The estimated annual debt service, to be paid from the Citys base rental payments pursuant to the Lease Agreement, would be approximately $3.1 million (interest only) through fiscal year 2020 and rise to approximately $4.4 million between fiscal years 2021 and 2047.  The Capital Improvement Program (CIP) appropriation for project construction is included in the FY 2017-18 budget in account C014083.589000.

Currently, only 10-18 percent of surplus edible food in the United States is recovered and distributed. This could be significantly improved through food waste prevention and donation. The City would use the grant funds to host a food forum that would bring together stakeholders from restaurants, businesses, and non-profits around Santa Monica to discuss food waste prevention and donations. While a vast network of food rescue organizations and businesses exist in the Los Angeles region, a food forum has not taken place in Santa Monica to bring together local stakeholders. The forum would raise awareness by educating local constituents and help to develop a stronger and better coordinated network. Once participating businesses have been identified, pre-waste audits would begin to benchmark the percentage of edible vs. non-edible food waste generated by these businesses. After the preliminary audit, businesses would receive necessary donation materials such as storage and pickup containers and, potentially, refrigerators depending on the volume and type of food donated.

Boerner Motor Companys Crane Carrier chassis and AMREP body bid submittal as the best bid for the purchase and delivery of six new and unused CNG Front Loaders as required by Fleet Management with the option to purchase up to seven additional vehicles for a total of 13 vehicles. Currently, 17 of the 19 existing Front Loaders in use by RRR are Crane Carrier chassis with an AMREP body. Fleet standardization helps to streamline maintenance costs, driver and mechanic training, as well as parts inventory management.  The Crane Carrier chassis has a lower cab front entry than other standard refuse vehicle chassis. The lower cab front entry makes it easier and safer for an RRR equipment operator and passenger side operator to enter and exit the vehicle. Operators enter and exit the vehicle over 100 times per day. In addition, when RRR equipment operators exit an alley, the lower cab allows for greater visibility of oncoming vehicle and pedestrian traffic.  Compared with similar bids for like chassis and body styles, the Fred M. Boerner Motor Company bid price offers an overall lower cost when taking the 10% early payment discount into account. Bids were evaluated based on the criteria in SMMC 2.24.072, including price, ability to deliver, quality of product, and compliance with City specifications.

It would be more costly to stock New Way and/or McNeilus parts and train staff on how to maintain this type of body and would be less safe for the Front Loader operators to get in and out of an Autocar chassis.

The overall length of the vehicle with the Autocar chassis and Dadee body is 22 shorter than the vehicle with the Autocar chassis and AMREP body and 6 shorter than the vehicle with the Crane Carrier chassis and a Dadee body. The shorter body length is essential for RRR operations as these vehicles are driven in tight alleys and must maneuver the many constraints of the Santa Monica operating area.  The Dadee Scorpion body has no cylinders inside the body. This eliminates the need for Fleet Management to conduct routine maintenance work inside the body. There is also no clean out area which eliminates the potential for a confined space hazard. RRR has been pleased with the performance of the vehicles in its fleet with Dadee Scorpion bodies and is moving to make its vehicle Fleet more uniform by utilizing one style of body for Side Loaders, further reducing maintenance costs and parts inventory. Bids were evaluated based on the criteria in SMMC 2.24.072, including price, ability to deliver, quality of product, and compliance with City specifications.

Approximately 3,200 (45%) of the City's 7,200 Badger meters and 6,800 (38%) of the City's total number of water meters were installed on or before 1996, and have reached or exceeded 20 years of age. Water meters are recommended to be replaced on a 20-year cycle to maintain accurate usage readings. Over the past five years, Water Resources staff have replaced an average of 655 meters per year; however, in order to maintain a 20-year replacement cycle, 905 meters would need to be replaced annually which staff believes is an achievable goal. If approved, staff would focus resources on water meter replacements to modernize the City's inventory.  Badger Meter, Inc. is a well-established manufacturer and supplier of meters throughout the industry, and the Water Resources Division has been utilizing Badger meters in the Citys water distribution system for more than 30 years. Over this time period, Badger meters have proven to be reliable and staff has gained a familiarity in maintaining the various models/sizes installed throughout Santa Monica. Badger meters are also economical compared to other brands, with the majority costing between $70 (5/8\" x 3/4\" size) and $351 (2\" size). Meters sized between 5/8\" x 3/4\" to 2\" make up 96% of the City's inventory. By comparison, a recent competitively bid purchase of 100 Neptune 5/8\" x 3/4\" T10 meters was made in June 2016 for $144.60 each, approximately double the price of an equivalent sized Badger meter. All new meters are enabled for automatic meter reading should the City opt to expand or continue the work to obtain real-time water usage data as part of the 200 account AMI Pilot project at a future date. AMI project smart meters provide real-time water usage data which allow customers to monitor water usage online via the Citys WaterSmart software. Instead of one meter read every two months, customers can immediately identify water leaks to prevent water waste as well as monitor and adjust their water usage to meet individual conservation and budget goals. Vendor SelectionBadger Meter, Inc. is the sole manufacturer and distributor of Badger meters in California. Similar to the purchase order Council awarded to Badger Meter, Inc. for the AMI Pilot project on November 11, 2014, staff recommends joining the City of Santa Barbara's contract with Badger Meter, Inc. based on Bid No. 5262A dated October 17, 2013 which solicited bids for water meters of similar technical specifications to those acceptable for use in Santa Monica's system under competitive bid procedures comparable to the City's. At an estimated purchase quantity of 4,250 meters per year, the City of Santa Barbara's contract provides the City of Santa Monica an opportunity to take advantage of pricing at economies of scale the City might not be able to achieve on its own based on estimated purchases of 900 to 1,000 meters per year. Staff has confirmed with the City of Santa Barbara that the contract is valid through November 4, 2018.  Pursuant to section 2.24.080(b) of the Santa Monica Municipal Code, Exception to Competitive Bidding, competitive bid procedures by the City need not be undertaken if they have already been utilized by Federal, State, County, City or special district government agencies, and these materials and services are supplied to the City at the same or better price, as was obtained through competitive bid procedures of Federal, State, County, City or special district government agencies. The City of Santa Barbara has used competitive bidding procedures.   The Public Works Department also contacted another vendor who stated that they could not match or beat the Badger contract awarded by the City of Santa Barbara.  Staff recommends awarding a purchase order to Badger Meter, Inc. in an amount not to exceed $300,000. AlternativesThe City could opt to issue an RFP for purchase of meters from other manufacturers. However, staff anticipates that this will not result in better pricing due to the economies of scale achieved under the City of Santa Barbaras contract. Neptune meters have historically been more expensive compared to the same size of Badger meter; therefore, although staff has observed the quality of Neptune meters to be satisfactory, smaller purchase amounts are planned moving forward due to this higher cost. Staff has found that Hersey meters do not meet the same levels of reliability or customer service as Badger or Neptune meters. For this reason the City discontinued purchase of Hersey meters in 2010. On October 13, 2015 (Attachment D), Council awarded a competitively bid purchase order to Metron-Farnier for purchase of single jet water meters for 3 years not to exceed $211,500; however, these meters are for higher usage multi-family and commercial lines (less than 2% of the City's inventory), cost significantly more per unit and are not suitable for smaller lines. To take advantage of favorable pricing, staff recommends continuing with Badger Meter, Inc. supplemented by smaller purchases of other brands of meters as needed. However, to avoid becoming solely reliant on one brand of meter, and to ensure an open and competitive process, staff also recommends bidding out provision of water meters on the open market closer to the expiration date of the City of Santa Barbara Badger Meter contract on November 4, 2018.  ", "background": "The City owns and maintains approximately 18,100 water meters throughout its water distribution system. 98% of the City's inventory is sourced from three manufacturers: Neptune (7,500 meters), Badger Meter (7,200 meters) and Hersey (3,000 meters; acquired by Mueller Systems in 2010). On March 12, 2013 (Attachment A), Council awarded a purchase order to Badger Meter, Inc. for the purchase of replacement meters in various sizes and repair parts in the amount of $60,000 per year, for a total amount of $180,000 over a three-year term, to rebuild or refurbish existing Badger meters within the Citys distribution system.

The preliminary project cost is approximately $57,050,000. The State has allocated over $900 million dollars for various response programs, including grants, and low interest financing. The State Water Board has indicated strong support for funding of the SWIP project via CWSRF low interest financing for up to the full project cost. As part of the State Water Board funding application and negotiation process, the preliminary costs will be refined and an initial funding agreement for the full amount of financing will be provided by the State Water Board to the City for consideration and finalization. Separate from the CWSRF financing, the City has requested for grant funds from round two of Proposition 1, which if successful would reduce the amount of financing required. The results of this application are pending. The State Water Board requires that the agency requesting funding provides a resolution (Attachments 4 and 5) authorizing the negotiation of funding agreements between the Water Board and the applicant agency (City of Santa Monica). Adoption of the resolution would not commit the City to accept any funding. City of Santa Monica Sustainable Water Infrastructure Project (SWIP) The SWIP is comprised of three integrated project elements to improve drought resiliency, increase water supply, and enhance flexibility in the management of the Citys water resources. Project Element 1 is the installation of a containerized, off-the-shelf saline reverse osmosis unit at the SMURRF. When operational, the reverse osmosis unit would be utilized to advance treat non-potable water resources such as urban and wet weather runoff harvested by the recently funded Clean Beaches Initiative (CBI) Project storage tanks to be constructed at the Deauville Parking Lot. These tanks will capture runoff from the 90-acre Pier Drainage Area that would normally be discharged to the ocean at the Pier Outfall. When runoff is scarce, the tanks would be replenished with brackish/saline groundwater from shallow horizontal subdrains installed beneath the CBI stormwater tanks. Project Element 2 includes the construction of a below grade recycled water treatment plant proposed beneath the Civic Center parking lot. The recycled water plant would advance treat approximately 1.0 million gallons/day (MGD) of municipal wastewater for reuse. Project Element 3 consists of two below grade stormwater harvest tanks. One tank would be constructed beneath Memorial Park, and the other adjacent to the below grade recycled water treatment facility. Project elements to be located under the Civic Center parking lot would be constructed to accommodate future development on the site. Benefits provided by the stormwater harvest tanks include capturing stormwater and urban runoff for treatment and reuse, improving beach water quality and complying with State Water Board Enhanced Watershed Management Plan (EWMP) requirements. Together, the Project elements would produce approximately 1.5 MGD (1,680 acre-feet/year) of new water for immediate non-potable reuse, and when properly permitted, for indirect potable reuse via aquifer recharge. All treated water would be distributed via the Citys existing purple pipe system.

In the event of a large earthquake, the structure could sustain severe damage and consequently emergency services to the community could be negatively impacted. The Fire Station No. 3 Seismic Retrofit project would strengthen the building and its infrastructure in order to maintain functionality after a large earthquake. Retrofit scope includes installing new shear walls and steel column and beam moment frames. ADA upgrades would bring the existing building up to code for publicly-accessible areas including a new main entry and access ramp. Additional ADA upgrades include the Officers quarters and public restrooms on the ground floor.  Fire Station No. 3 houses two engine companies, Engine 3 and Engine 4, which are comprised of fire personnel. Areas of the building would be vacated to allow construction of the seismic upgrades. During construction, Engine 3 would remain at Fire Station No. 3 and would transition occupancy to one half the building while work is done on the other half. Engine 4 would be temporarily relocated into the newly constructed Fire Training Center trailers at the City Yards. The fire apparatus (fire truck), located in the apparatus bay, would also transition between locations within Fire Station No. 3 depending on the construction schedule. The fire apparatus is required to be functional throughout construction in order to meet Type I Hazardous Materials Response Program requirements. Existing kitchen and restrooms that would serve the fire personnel during construction are outside of the work zones and would not be disrupted. Because the Fire Department and Fire Station No. 3 are required to provide community services 24 hours per day, seven days per week throughout the year, several alterations would be made to the traditional contracting schedule. These include work stoppage times between the hours of 12:00 pm  2:00 pm and the curtailment of excessively noisy construction practices in certain areas of the facility. Vendor SelectionOn November 8, 2016, the City published a Notice Inviting Bids to provide construction services for the Fire Station No. 3 Seismic Retrofit project in accordance with City specifications. The bid was posted on the City's on-line bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provisions. A total of 1,666 vendors were notified, 61 vendors downloaded the bid, and 11 vendors attended the mandatory pre-bid job walk. One bid was received and publicly opened on December 12, 2016, per Attachment D. The bid was evaluated based on the criteria in SMMC 2.24.072, including price, previous experience, capacity and skill, ability to deliver, quality of product, and compliance with City specifications and scope of work.  Public Works staff conducted additional outreach to vendors who downloaded the bid to see why they did not submit a bid; responses included concerns related to work being too complicated, the work would be in an occupied building, problems with the fire apparatus coming and going throughout the day, the constricted work hours (8:00 am to 6:00 pm limits with 10:00 am to 2:00 pm the only time to do noisy work) combined with quiet time requirements for fire fighters to sleep (12:00 pm to 2:00 pm), and some vendors were too busy to submit a bid.  Hoffman Management & Construction Corporation (HMCC) submitted a bid within the projects budget, was fully responsive in its bid documents, provided timely responses to inquiries from staff and received positive responses from references. Staff also verified with the Contractors State License Board that Hoffman Management and Construction Corporation and its subcontractors licenses are current, active, and in good standing.  Based on these criteria, HMCC is recommended as the best bidder. ", "background": "In August 2012, the City solicited proposals from qualified consulting firms to provide professional services for the structural evaluation and the design of seismic upgrades for Fire Station No. 3. The Request for Proposals (RFP) outlined two phases for the design process: 1) Feasibility and Schematic Design and 2) Construction Documents. In November 2012, the City executed Professional Services Agreement (PSA) No. 2569 with IDS Group, Inc. for the amount of $28,000 to provide feasibility and schematic design services including structural evaluation for the Fire Station No. 3 Seismic Retrofit project.  This project started in November 2012 as a feasibility study only. At the conclusion of the study the City implemented a phased design process that rolled out over the course of a number of modifications, ensuring the project would continue before proceeding further. Implementation of the design has been further delayed by the construction logistics of establishing a temporary fire station at the city yards to house half the stations fire fighters. This process, along with staffing limitations and change over, caused the design phase to proceed slower than originally anticipated and required modifications 3, 4, and 5. On July 23, 2013 (Attachment A), Council authorized the City to execute the first modification to PSA No. 2569 / 9771 (CCS) with IDS Group, Inc. for an amended contract amount of $64,350, and a new not to exceed contract total of $92,350. Additionally, the City executed contract modifications 2, 3, and 4 with IDS Group, Inc. to both extend the contract term and encumber project funds that were within the Council authorized budget. On June 28, 2016 (Attachment B), Council authorized the City to execute the fifth modification to PSA No. 2569 / 9771 (CCS) with IDS Group, Inc. to complete final design services including bidding assistance and construction administration for a new not to exceed contract total of $129,090.  On January 10, 2017 (Attachment C), Council authorized the City to execute a construction contract with West Valley Investments, Inc. to construct the site improvements necessary for the temporary trailers at the city yards.

Ordinances", "body": {"other": "A fundamental expectation in the occupancy of residential and commercial structures is that buildings are safe and free from hazard. Buildings that provide resistance to the destructive forces of earthquakes and aftershocks are an essential component in building safety and occupancy. Strengthening of older less resistant buildings is necessary in order to provide the structural resiliency to increase occupant safety. An update to the Citys existing seismic retrofit standards and implementing retrofit requirements for potentially vulnerable buildings would provide increased measures of occupant safety. The proposed ordinance, Attachment A, provides updates of the seismic retrofit requirements adopted by the City Council on June 8, 1999.  Both California state laws regulating Building Code adoption and California Health and Safety Code Sections 19101 and 19162-63.6 authorize local jurisdictions to establish mandatory seismic retrofit standards. Pursuant to Section 18941.5 of the California Health and Safety Code, amendments to the California Building Standards Code are required to be justified by local climatic, geological and topographical conditions. The attached Resolution with proposed local findings is provided in Attachment B. Staff has identified buildings that may be potentially seismically vulnerable and has represented these buildings in an inventory (List) provided as Attachment C. The Seismic Retrofit Program (Program) will target these identified unretrofitted buildings where Program compliance and enforcement will be required in conformance with the schedule outlined in the ordinance.  Retrofitting seismically vulnerable buildings is proposed through an active and ongoing Seismic Retrofit Program. The Program will include identification, notification, compliance procedures, and residential tenant protections. In addition, timely processing and compliance will also require consultant services to provide structural plan check and peer review of complex structural retrofit designs. Should Council adopt the Resolution and Ordinance, staff will initiate a Request for Proposal for the procurement of engineering consultant services to address processing of seismic retrofit plans and to maintain expected service levels in construction permitting. The proposed ordinance also seeks revisions to Chapter 8.100 Tenant Protection During Construction and Chapter 4.36 Tenant Relocation Assistance. Revisions to these Chapters will enhance existing tenant protections and incorporate measures for hazardous material cases. A proposed revision includes addressing issues related to hazardous materials found in older construction materials. Additional proposed revisions will also require building owners to pay for environmental consulting services in the determination and resolution of hazardous materials. To address this issue, staff is recommending the issuance of a Request for Proposal for the procurement of environmental consultant services. Since construction work has the potential to impact existing residential tenants, passage of the seismic retrofit ordinance and the resulting construction has the potential to create impacts to existing tenants. The implementation of the Program will include means for tenant advocacy and advisory. All affected City Departments will engage in the support of residential tenants and the response to retrofit compliances. Retrofitting, or the strengthening of the structural system of older seismically vulnerable buildings increases the lateral load resisting system in these older buildings allowing better performance in earthquakes and aftershocks. Better performance will significantly reduce the potential for building damage and collapse, lessening the occurrences of occupant injury or death. The updates to the technical standards for seismic retrofit in the proposed ordinance are recommended to improve performance of buildings to levels similar to minimum life-safety levels of the State building code. Although minimum life-safety levels of seismic retrofit does not eliminate the possibility of injury or death due to building damage, the proposed standards would result in substantial gains in protecting the Citys inhabitants, workers and visitors.Seismic Retrofit Program ImplementationList  Potentially Seismically Vulnerable BuildingsAt the December 6, 2016 Study Session, staff presented to Council that the identification and inventory (List) of potentially seismically vulnerable buildings will be available in January 2017. The List was made publically available on January 26, 2017 on a City webpage dedicated to the Seismic Retrofit Program. As indicated on the List, all types of seismically vulnerable buildings will be targeted for notification, structural analysis and if found to be deficient, the requirement to complete retrofit of the building. The List is an inventory of buildings that may require retrofit based on determination through building permit records and visual identification. In addition, the List will be dynamic as a structural analysis of some buildings may find that a building does not require retrofit in which case the building would be removed from the list. Likewise, buildings not currently on the List may someday be identified as requiring retrofit when structural systems are revealed during tenant modifications to the buildings. The List will serve as a basis in the milestone steps towards retrofit compliance with iterative steps noted once completed.  Notification, Time Limits and Recordation of PropertiesOwners of buildings on the List will be notified that their building has been identified as potentially seismically vulnerable. Once notified, a building owner will be required to provide a structural analysis of the building and a recommendation for a retrofit solution, if necessary. The notification will serve as the official commencement of the time period in which the building owner has to comply with milestones of compliance. The proposed ordinance identifies priorities of hazardous building types in which notification will be phased by order of hazard severity, compliance timeframe and building type. The phasing of the notices will allow for the segmenting of 4,594 notices to building owners. The overall compliance time limit is provided per building type in the table below. Potentially Seismically Vulnerable Buildings TypeYears to Complete RetrofitUnreinforced Masonry Buildings2 YearsConcrete Tilt-Up Buildings3 YearsSoft-Story Buildings6 YearsNon-Ductile Concrete Buildings10 YearsSteel Moment Frame Buildings20 YearsSingle-Family Brace and BoltsVoluntary            In the case of multiple ownership of a building where a building consists of multiple parcels such as condominiums, each owner of a parcel will receive a notice. The List identifies condominium buildings by legal address with individual parcels.  The proposed ordinance includes major milestones in the process of seismic retrofitting of a building. The milestones include interim deadlines that will allow for compliance monitoring. Consultation by staff will be available to advise the small family-owned residential owners and small business/building owners with information necessary for understanding the steps of compliance in the retrofit process. At the December 6, 2016 Study Session, Council directed staff to examine the effects of a recorded notice on the title of a property. Staff explored if a recording will introduce constraints from lending institutions on property loans and discovered that there will be no significant effect. Staff is recommending that the proposal for a recorded notice will be a positive factor in the achievement of retrofit compliance as well as fair disclosure to parties involved in the affected properties. Staff will propose general language on the notice to be recorded with the County of Los Angeles Office of the Registrar/Recorder as to not overburden impact on title transfers and the securing of loans including loans for the financing of seismic retrofit. Both the City of Los Angeles and the City and County of San Francisco have included recordation of seismic retrofit requirements in their process. Consultant ServicesBuildings with complex structural systems, such as the Steel Moment Frame and Non-Ductile Concrete buildings will have detailed complicated retrofit solutions. Complex retrofit designs will require peer review which is a standard practice in structural design of complicated buildings. Peer review is the process where an independent structural engineer reviews the design of a retrofit plan and provides input to best practices in the structural design of a project. Peer review is a detailed highly-technical exercise involving specialized expertise that should be handled by consultant services. Therefore, staff recommends incorporating the procedure of peer review as a necessary part of seismic retrofit. Costs for peer review will be proposed and presented to the City Council as part of the FY 2017-19 biennial budget.   In addition to peer review, the volume of plans anticipated for seismic retrofit will require consulting services for the plan check of seismic retrofit designs. The consulting services will augment Building and Safety staff, as-needed, for the plan review of large complex buildings and for peak submittals of plans. Funding for consultant plan check will be incorporated with the FY 2017-19 biennial City budget. It is recommended that City Council authorize staff to issue a Request for Proposals for consultant services for seismic retrofit plan check and peer review. Parking EffectsThe structural strengthening of a building related to seismic retrofit may have an effect on parking spaces by reducing the dimensions of a required parking space or in some cases eliminating required parking. Where the retrofit solution provides that there is no alternate practical solutions to a retrofit, the proposed ordinance provides that the Zoning Administrator may reduce the required size of a parking space or the number of required spaces. The proposal is that parking shall not be reduced more than twenty-percent (20%) of required parking spaces or one (1) space, whichever is greater. Tenant Protection Protection of tenants and the stock of affordable housing in the City are of paramount importance. Construction in residential buildings, if not conducted or monitored with diligence could be of significant impact to tenants. The proposed ordinance provides for several amendments to strengthen tenant protections for standard ongoing construction projects, and for construction related to the Seismic Retrofit Program. Added requirements and revisions to Chapters 8.100 and 4.36 are presented as part of the proposed ordinance.Enhancements to Tenant Protection During Construction, Chapter 8.100The following proposed revisions to Chapter 8.100 are purposed to enhance protection of tenants during construction activity.         Older buildings are likely to contain building materials of hazardous content and if disturbed, can be of detrimental effect to humans and possibly pets. Materials such as asbestos and lead paint may still be present in some of the buildings that require seismic retrofit. Existing State Law procedures require a building owner to abate hazardous materials in accordance with procedures of the Southern California Air Quality Management District (AQMD). Proper adherence to these procedures should provide tenants with the assurance that hazardous materials are abated and no longer pose a health threat. Staff proposes to add additional requirements to Chapter 8.100 to: (1) clarify that owners must ensure that all hazardous materials are properly handled during construction; (2) the City will actively monitor such handling; and (3) the City may reasonable engage the services of qualified experts, at the owners expense, to assist the City in evaluating the owners compliance.         Relatedly, staff also request that the City Council instruct staff to initiate a Request for Proposals to procure the services of licensed environmental consultants as advisors to the City on issues of hazardous materials.         Section 8.100.040(c)(9) requires a building owner to provide monthly notices to tenants on construction progress for projects that exceed thirty-days of construction. This section also allows the Building Officer to request meetings to allow tenant feedback to construction issues. Proposed with this ordinance is clarifying that the request of the Building Officer is not appealable given the timeliness of a requested meeting and tenant concerns. Enhancements to Tenant Relocation Assistance, Chapter 4.36The following clarifications and enhancements are proposed to Chapter 4.36 to address improvements and revisions in tenant relocation.         For short-term tenant displacements (e.g. due to inoperable equipment such as hot water heating or environmental heat) a proposal to allow owners to relocate tenants to a hotel is presented in the ordinance. The relocation to a hotel would be an option instead of paying the daily per diem, or providing comparable housing if relocation is estimated to be five days or less. Tenants would be entitled to per diem payments or be relocated to comparable accommodations if relocation extends beyond five days. Staff is proposing five days as a measure for timely relocations as staff determined that the majority of relocations are typically at five days or less.          Existing law does not require owners to expeditiously repair tenant units while tenants are relocated. In some relocation cases, the extent of a tenant being relocated was not proportionate to the estimated time to address the condition causing the relocation. A proposal to require a maximum time limit in which a tenant is relocated is included in the ordinance. The estimated maximum time frame will be based on the condition causing relocation as determined by the Building Officer. Should the estimated time limit be exceeded, an investigation will be warranted to determine causes for the delay. Where relocation is in excess of the estimated time limit without reasonable cause, the Code Enforcement Division would initiate enforcement action.         As timely resolution is desired in a relocation case to remedy conditions of uninhabitability, added language to Chapter 4.36 is proposed to ensure that the owner has access to the rental unit and have the opportunity to timely address the condition without interference from the tenant. This is proposed to address recent issues where building owners were prevented by a tenant from making necessary repairs causing relocations to be prolonged. Staff asserts that this allowance will provide for timely resolutions.         Sections 4.36.120(c) and (d) currently do not allow relocation benefits when a tenant is displaced as a result of seismic retrofit. Research determined that this language was written in the 1999 seismic retrofit ordinance. It was included in hopes of incentivizing owners to commence retrofitting; however, experience has shown that this incentive is ineffective and that it unnecessarily burdens tenants. Staff proposes that this Section be repealed to meet current relocation goals of the City. Eliminating this provision will likely also encourage more timely completion of seismic retrofit projects. Exemptions to Zonal Restrictions on ConstructionDue to the mandated timeline contained in the seismic retrofit ordinance, it is possible that seismic retrofit of several multi-family buildings may occur simultaneously. However, local law (namely the Construction Rate Program of Chapter 9.37.110) only allows one project (involving the new construction or alteration of 2 or more dwelling units in the R2, R3, R4, OF, RMH, OPD, OP2, OP3, and OP4 Districts) to occur within a 500-foot radius at a time. This restriction could have a negative impact on the retrofit compliance efforts of multi-family buildings. Although Section 9.37.110 contains an exemption for seismic retrofit projects, that exemption only applies to unreinforced masonry type buildings. The proposed ordinance seeks to override this prohibition and allow all seismic retrofit projects to proceed simultaneously. Tenant and Occupant AdvisoryThe proposed ordinance includes a requirement that building owners must notify each residential and commercial tenant when the Building Officer determines that a building is seismically vulnerable and subject to retrofit to comply with local law. This notice is an advisory to tenants and will include references to contacts in the City for assistance. As part of milestone compliance, the building owner is required to provide the Department with evidence that each tenant has been provided with the tenant advisory related to seismic retrofit. For buildings that will require retrofit construction, Chapter 8.100 currently requires posting of Construction Notification (on a 30-inch by 40-inch poster) that states effects during the construction and interruptions to building services.   Public Assistance, Public InformationStaff will be available for general and detailed questions for each aspect of compliance with the Program. To assist with general information, a webpage dedicated to the Seismic Retrofit Program in already available on the Citys website.WebpageOn January 26, 2017, the Department launched the Seismic Retrofit Program webpage which includes the List of potentially seismically vulnerable buildings. Should Council adopt the ordinance, the webpage will be updated with program information for owners and tenants.  Other information planned for the webpage will include financing information for loan assistance for seismic retrofit. This will include the seven private financiers listed on the Resolution that City Council approved on February 23, 2016 as indicated in the Study Session report. Planned with Councils passage of the ordinance is a Seismic Retrofit Fair where building owners, residential and commercial tenants and business merchants may obtain information about the Seismic Retrofit Program in a one stop event. In addition to City staff, financiers, product vendors, consulting architects and engineers, and building contractors who specialize in seismic retrofit will have a presence at the Fair. The webpage will provide event dates, and information related to the Seismic Retrofit Fair. A major component in achieving compliance of the Seismic Retrofit Program is the timely completion of a building retrofit. A key factor in timely compliance is staffs ability to process applications, structural reports, seismic design plans and the issuance of building permits. Three additional positions will provide the needed resources to address additional workload such as resident and owner services, application-notification-recordation processing, structural engineering analysis and customer guidance. The positions will be covered with new revenues and presented as part of the FY 2017-19 biennial budget process.  Cost and Financing of RetrofitThe Study Session Staff Report contained approximate costs for seismic retrofit. Staff reported at the Study Session that State Assembly Bill 837 set up the California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program Fund for residences and small businesses related to seismic retrofit. This Bill is now codified as California Health and Safety Code 44559.14 and provides another source of financing for seismic retrofit.At the December 6, 2016 Study Session, Council asked if previous seismic retrofit funding after the 1994 Northridge Earthquake from the Federal and State governments granted to building owners in Santa Monica might still be available. Research found that many buildings were retrofitted utilizing grant monies, however, the funds are no longer available. Rent Control Board HearingShould City Council adopt the proposed ordinance, following the second reading of the ordinance, the Rent Control Board will be presented with a request to determine the extent of pass-through costs of retrofit work to tenants. The Rent Control Board will be asked to determine if pass-through costs should be included as part of monthly tenant rents, and if so, the percentage of retrofit cost attributed to the pass-through, the total term and the maximum monthly pass-through costs. CEQA ExemptionThe proposed ordinance is categorically exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) pursuant to Sections 15061(b)(3), 15301 and 15302 of the CEQA Guidelines.  Section 15301 provides exemption for a class of projects (Class 1) consisting of repair, maintenance or minor alterations to public or private structures or facilities involving negligible or no expansion of use.  Section 15302 provides exemption for a class of projects (Class 2) consisting of replacement or reconstruction of existing structures or facilities where the new structure or facility will be located on the same site and will have substantially the same purpose and capacity.  The proposed ordinance requires repair, maintenance and minor alterations of existing structures and facilities to meet minimum seismic safety standards.  The ordinance does not require or contemplate any appreciable expansion or change in use or capacity of any existing structure or facility.  Accordingly, the ordinance is categorically exemption pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Sections 15301 and 15302.  Additionally, the proposed ordinance is also exempt pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3) because, as described by this Staff Report, it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the proposed ordinance could have a significant effect on the environment.", "background": "On December 6, 2016, City Council conducted a Study Session on the degree of seismically vulnerable buildings1 in Santa Monica that are subject to damage or collapse in a seismic event.

Based on the evidence in the record, it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the proposed changes may have a significant effect on the environment. The recommended modifications represent minor changes, corrections, and clarifications to the Zoning Ordinance including proposed changes related to Accessory Dwelling Units to be consistent with recent changes in State law that do not substantively affect policy decisions made with the City Councils adoption of the Zoning Ordinance. Therefore, no further environmental review under CEQA is required.  ", "background": "On June 23, 2015, the City Council adopted a new Zoning Ordinance that became effective on July 24, 2015.

Administrative Item", "body": {"other": "Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) allows local governments to purchase and sell electricity to customers in their jurisdictions as an alternative to traditional investor owned utility (IOU) power procurement. Existing CCAs in other parts of California provide higher levels of renewable energy to their customers and offer lower prices than the IOUs that previously served them. In order for Santa Monica to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 or sooner, sourcing electricity from renewable sources is an essential strategy. Santa Monica consumes over 900,000 MWh per year, with an approximate gross revenue value of $55 million.The LA County Business Plan concluded that the formation of a Los Angeles Community Choice Energy program (LACCE) is financially viable and would yield considerable benefits for the Countys residents and businesses, including:         Lower rates  The LACCE rate for 50% renewable energy could be 4% lower than the Southern California Edison (SCE) base rate for an energy mix that includes only 28% renewables. The LACCE rate with 100% renewables could be only 6% higher than SCEs base rate.          Greenhouse Gas Reductions  At full implementation of LACCE, GHG emissions in Los Angeles County could be reduced by 7% at a 50% renewable content and by 14% at a 100% renewable content.          Economic development and jobs  LACCE could support the development of local and regional energy projects, creating local jobs.          Local Control and Energy Management  The County and cities would have the ability to offer choices for retail customers, like varying levels of renewable energy at different prices. Funding could be acquired for end-user programs such as energy efficiency, retail distributed generation, energy storage, water efficiency, and electric vehicle charging, etc.While this study was done specifically to develop the Los Angeles Community Choice Energy program, the similar benefits could be delivered to Santa Monica or a subregional CCA. Both LA County and South Bay Clean Power have convened stakeholder working groups to negotiate the governing structures and relationship between a County and subregional CCA. There are several options that the City could pursue to implement a CCA, each with pros and cons:1.     Engage the Los Angeles Community Choice Energy program, and participate in Joint Powers Authority formation2.     Engage the South Bay Clean Power subregional CCA program, and participate in Joint Powers Authority formation3.     Independently seek to become a CCA as a City, and contract services for initiation from Lancaster Choice Energy, or a private third partyThe City could participate in stakeholder workshops and negotiations to form a Joint Powers Authority (JPA) agreement with the County and participating cities. Even once formed, there is no obligation to join LACCE should it not meet the Citys needs. As a member of the JPA, there would be no cost to the City for initial power procurement or program initiation costs or services. The City could have a seat on the LACCE JPA Board of Directors and would have the opportunity to work with the LACBOS and up to 81 other cities within the County. The County has initially proposed a voting structure that would give each city one vote, unless a board member calls for a weighted vote. The weighting of votes could be based on the electric power load of the members or some other weighting formula. Currently with the County and 37 interested cities as potential members, Santa Monica would have a weighted vote of 3.89%, ranking as the 6th largest electrical consumer behind the County, Long Beach, Torrance, Carson, Santa Clarita and Industry. Benefits of Joining LACCE         Los Angeles County has financial strength and human resources         The County has experience and expertise with running countywide programs         The County has the potential to be the largest CCA in California with 5 County districts and 82 eligible cities, and therefore wield the greatest amount of purchasing power         The County would secure funding and services for all participating cities         The County would assume all of the risk associated with starting a CCA         There is strong support from County Supervisors and staff         The City of Santa Monica, as a South Bay Clean Power city, has been engaged in the CCA feasibility process for two years and is well positioned to influence the goals, mission, design, policy, and procedures of the JPA Potential Disadvantages of Joining LACCE         The County could move slowly due to size and miss important deadlines and milestone dates         The County has no prior experience with CCA and would rely on outside consultants that are also available to South Bay Clean Power cities and the City of Santa Monica         Because of the size and diversity of County cities, the JPA may not reflect the values and goals of the City of Santa Monica          There could be less local control and influence, working with such a large number of cities         The City would not receive any direct revenue from CCA operationsThe City could join a JPA with other interested South Bay and Westside cities and establish a subregional CCA. Each participating city would be represented with a seat on the JPA Board of Directors. SBCP would issue a Request for Services that includes all CCA funding and development costs with no cost to any individual city. The City, as a board member, would have the opportunity to determine and approve all goals and objectives of the program. SBCP has signaled that it would pursue an advanced CCA model that promotes maximizing local distributed energy resources (like rooftop solar) and the necessary build-out and job creation to do so. SBCP would hire an experienced Executive Director or CEO to run the CCAs power authority and hire staff. SBCP would employ best practices from existing public power and regional power authorities. SBCP could collaborate as a subregional CCA with the LACCE to share economies of scale, but still retain autonomous decision-making. Currently with among the 14 interested cities, Santa Monica would have a 14% and 15% weighted vote by population and electric load, respectively. Benefits of Joining SBCP         SBCP has access to the same funding and services as Los Angeles County          SBCP could collaborate and share economies of scale with the County without having a dedicated County seat on the LACCE Board of Directors         SBCP could have lowest possible rates due to a greater combined power load than the remaining power load of LACCE, Lancaster Clean Energy, or any other CCA in California         SBCP cities share common ground and would support new economic opportunities and environmental justice to frontline refinery communities.          SBCP is committed to CCA revenue going back into the program to maximize positive economic and environmental impacts         SBCPs ability to be a statewide leader in the Distributed Energy Resources model is already embraced by state regulators and SCE         An existing strong and diverse coalition of stakeholders, political supporters, and endorsers provides advantages neither LACCE or LCE have         SBCP has over 2 years of Working Group experience and networking of CCA connections statewide and County-wide         With a much smaller membership the governance model for SBCP JPA would be simpler than that for LACCE, would provide the City of Santa Monica with a greater voice in decisions, and would serve as a model for other regional CCAs in the County to work together. Potential Disadvantages of Joining SBCP         There is the potential that SBCP cities could drop out and undermine the viability of the JPA         There could be disagreement on goals and objectives and inability to come to a JPA governance agreement         There is no proof of ability to achieve 50% renewables portfolio at a lower rate than SCE, as no feasibility study or business plan was developed specifically for SBCP         SBCP may have a challenge gathering enough community support and participation to achieve the high uptake rate that is required to be successful and competitive         SBCP may not be able to attract or retain a top quality Executive Director or CEO to run the CCAs power authority         The County could oppose SBCP and refuse to collaborate         There could be less local control and influence, working with a smaller group of cities of whom some may have greater influence due to their weighted vote potential         The City would not receive any direct revenue from CCA operationsLancaster Choice Energy Service (LCE) has offered cities and counties its services to develop and launch CCAs. The City could pay LCE $154,000 in two phases to produce load forecasting, data analysis, and pro-forma development based on the citys energy data. LCE would prepare an Ordinance of Intent to Form a CCA and Implementation Plan Document for the City. Once the CCA is operating, the City would pay a monthly fee for LCE Services. Council would have the ability to set the rates, determine the percentage of renewables, set the policy and program elements, do community outreach marketing, and have local governance and oversight. The City would be free to use revenue from the program for any General Fund purpose.  Benefits of Hiring LCE         Lancaster has experience operating the only CCA in Los Angeles County and SCE territory         The City would have sole control over the energy destiny without partnering with any other city or the County         The CCA could be branded as the City of Santa Monicas alone, creating an opportunity to establish an integrated utility of water, waste management & electricity services         The City would have the ability to use revenue from the CCA to finance City projects of any kind         City Council and staff would have complete control of the program         No participation in a JPA would be required         The City would have access to Lancasters current and future renewable energy portfolioPotential Disadvantages of Hiring LCE         The up-front cost for development is not required by other options         The program would not be anchored by a JPA, which would place the Citys General Fund at risk if the CCA became insolvent         The cost for energy to consumers would likely be higher than other options as a smaller CCA         Lancaster is the States smallest CCA, less than two years old, and the only single city non-JPA CCA in California         There is no apparent value-added: all consultants and vendors that would provide key services are also available to cities, County, or SBCP directly without the LCE markup cost         LCE has no distributed energy focus, goals or commitment to building out local energy resources, jobs, job training, apprenticeship programs, or help for impacted and frontline communitiesCCAs can also be developed and implemented directly by third party service providers. Power services companies provide a broad array of expert services and are experienced in risk management and scheduling for public power agencies. They can still buy power from Power Marketers for the CCA, but have more options and flexibility; and they are agnostic as to what combination of wholesale power and local distributed energy best meet the CCAs power needs. The City could issue a request for proposals to conduct a feasibility study, develop a business plan and select a service provider to initiate CCA services on behalf of the City, with no startup costs. The selected provider would provide these services and recoup its costs through the electrical rates. As no study has been performed at the City level, it is undetermined if this would be a cost-competitive offer compared to SCE, LACCE, SBCP or LCE. The City would be free to use revenue from the program for any General Fund purpose. Benefits of Third Party Service Providers         Service providers will bear the risk of CCA formation         Service providers will have incentive to ensure the CCA is successful in order to recoup their capital costs         No participation in a JPA would be required         The City would have sole control over the energy services and programs without partnering with any other city or the County         The CCA could be branded as the City of Santa Monicas alone, creating an opportunity to establish an integrated utility of water, waste management & electricity services         All CCA net revenues would be directed to the General Fund for community energy services          The City Council and staff would have complete direct control of the programPotential Disadvantages of Third Party Service Providers         The program would not be anchored by a JPA, which would place the Citys General Fund at risk if the CCA became insolvent         Additional City staff and resources would need to be dedicated to managing the CCA         The ongoing cost may not be as competitive as other options         There is only one precedent of a city-only CCA; Santa Monica would be a small CCA, and the second non-JPA CCAThe City may participate in the LACCE JPA formation discussions with no obligation to participate in the actual JPA implementation. The LA County Chief Executive Officer will present the final draft LACCE JPA document to the LACBOS for approval. The LACCE JPA would be formed when at least one other city becomes a member. After which, Council would have to approve its participation in the LACCE. If the City does not join the JPA within a specified period, the City may risk having a smaller role in initiation and/or initiation costs that would not be applied to initial members. The City may also participate in the SBCP JPA formation discussions with no obligation to participate in the actual JPA implementation. Once a final draft JPA is agreed upon by participating stakeholders, South Bay Clean Power will work with member cities to support its adoption and approval. A minimum number of cities and amount of electrical load will be required for the SBCP CCA to be successful, but that amount has not been determined. Staff are currently attending meetings of both groups to monitor their processes, but require Council direction in order to fully participate in the JPA negotiations. In order to proceed, staff recommend that Council provide direction to staff to pursue one or more options of implementing a CCA. Staff also recommends Council adopt the attached resolution which would affirm Santa Monicas goals and objectives as a platform for negotiations; and appoint a Council representative, staff liaison and alternate liaison to participate in formal negotiations.On January 23, 2017, staff presented the Task Force on the Environment with an update on the Citys involvement to date in local CCA activities. The Task Force on the Environment adopted a motion to support the Citys participation in both the LACCE and SBCP JPA formation discussions and recommends that Council adopt the draft platform of goals and objectives when entering negotiations:Draft Goals:         To eliminate carbon emissions associated with Santa Monicas electricity generation sources by 2050 or sooner         To achieve the highest rate of renewable sources that are cost competitive         To increase the deployment of energy efficiency and demand response services, distributed energy resources, electric vehicle infrastructure and other clean technologies in Santa Monica and the Los Angeles metro area Draft Objectives:         Implement or participate in a community choice energy/aggregation with goals and objectives that are aligned with Santa Monicas goals and objectives         Seek to achieve the highest percentage of renewable energy from local sources and the highest level of participation in the community         Ensure that Santa Monica has voting representation that reflects its achievements in energy efficiency, solar and electric vehicles deployment, or population, instead of total electrical load         Ensure that Santa Monica will receive a sustainable and equitable source of funds that will support projects that reduce emissions from energy and fossil fuel use         Ensure that all Santa Monicans will have equitable and affordable access to clean energy and energy services ", "background": "On January 13, 2015, Council adopted a non-binding resolution to join 12 cities from the South Bay and Westside cities area in what is collectively known as South Bay Clean Power in a study that would assess the feasibility of a subregional CCA.

Based on the direction of the Land Use and Circulation Element to develop a Specific Plan for Downtown, the DCP establishes a balanced framework of policies, standards and actions that support the various roles that Downtown plays as a residential neighborhood, a regional job center, an international tourist destination and a community living room.Spanning nearly six years in development, work on the DCP has been extensive and far-reaching, touching thousands of people who live, work or visit the Downtown. Throughout this timeframe, people have followed the trajectory of this comprehensive planning document through multiple versions and have passionately advocated for a range of outcomes that speak to the diversity of perspectives within our community. The Final DCP is the culmination of this engaging dialogue, and a record of the Citys effort to balance the myriad priorities of a community that aspires to achieve the best outcome for our central heart of commercial, cultural and entertainment activity. There has largely been support for the Plans overall approach. However, a plan of this significance inevitably highlights diverse views on the shape and scope of future new development in our community, including those who argue that the plan would allow too much growth in our Downtown and those who maintain it would overly restrict the supply of new housing. Beyond those philosophical differences, three specific issues bear particular attention that are highlighted for Council consideration in Chapter 3 of this report.The DCP has been endorsed by the Planning Commission, the Housing Commission, the Recreation and Parks Commission, the Arts Commission, the Landmarks Commission, the Architectural Review Board and the Social Services Commission. In particular, the Planning Commission held six meetings to take extensive public testimony and review in detail the final draft released on April 12th of this year. Staff has endorsed virtually all of the Planning Commissions recommendations and incorporated them into our recommendations to the Council in this report. The Commission also carefully reviewed the Final Environmental Impact Report and recommends its certification by the Council.   This report provides a synopsis of the final regulatory and policy framework that will guide all future public and private investment in the Downtown, and provides detail on Plan highlights surrounding housing production, historic preservation, the creation of public spaces, and mobility changes. It describes in general terms the six-year outreach effort to bend Plan concepts towards agreement, and highlights several challenging spotlight issues that remain for the Council to weigh-in on. The Plan also includes an Implementation and Monitoring Plan, which involves sequencing recommended changes over time and deploying resources to the areas of greatest need. Importantly, the Monitoring Plan includes a cap on development as a measure to control the pace of change and ensure that it is in accordance with LUCE and DCP goals.Since the release of the Draft DCP in April 2016, staff has conducted or attended over 50 public meetings to present the Plan. Feedback, comments and questions have been generated from neighborhood groups, individuals, business organizations, trade professionals, and nearly all of the Citys Boards and Commissions, including six recent hearings before the Planning Commission.  The Final Plan has been modified based on this input, as summarized in this report and detailed in an attached list.The Downtown Community Plan is organized for readability and visual access to the key concepts that make up the Plan. The Plan is composed of 6 Chapters and an Appendix. The following summarizes the Plans six chapters: Chapter 1: IntroductionIntroduces the vision for Downtown Santa Monica, and provides background for the development of the principles that guide the Plans goals and policies. This chapter is useful to the reader who wishes to understand the larger planning context and anticipated outcomes over the 20-year time horizon of the Downtown Community Plan.  Chapter 2A: Downtown DistrictsThis chapter introduces the Downtowns seven land use districts and provides information on the communitys priorities for benefits that would stem from new developments. The process and structure of the DCP entitlement system is also described in this chapter. Chapter 2B: Community, Culture, Prosperity Describes the Plans overarching commitment to developing a long-term, sustainable community in the Downtown. Provides detail on strategies for increasing housing production, and maintaining and enhancing Downtowns existing diversity of businesses and economic health into the future. This substantive chapter also outlines the importance of building upon the existing public art and event program to nurture cultural activities, including an anchor museum, live music and performances, theater and cinema and other creative enterprises. Chapter 2C: Historic PreservationHistory plays a central role in Downtowns character. This chapter underlines the importance of Downtowns historic resources, which includes City Designated historic resources and potential historic resources, and describes the protections that are provided in the DCP to retain important or character-defining buildings, as well as incentives that make adaptive reuse an attractive option to redevelopment.  Chapter 2D: Pathways and Public SpacesSidewalks form the framework for pedestrian movement through the City, often to public places for gathering, recreation or entertainment. This chapter strengthens the relationship between sidewalks and public spaces with guidance for design, orientation, and access. Importantly, this chapter outlines strategies for increasing public space offerings Downtown. Chapter 2E: Supportive Infrastructure This chapter examines the condition of existing utilities in the Downtown and provides strategies for implementing improvements necessary for realizing the Plans vision and supporting the projected increase in residents. Chapter 3: Access and MobilityPeople get to - and move throughout - the Downtown in many different ways. This chapter looks at Downtown circulation as a network of interconnected parts and defines a coordinated set of actions related to design, operations, management and innovation. These include changes to both private property and property owned and managed by the City of Santa Monica.  Chapter 4: Standards and RegulationsFor property owners and designers, this Chapter defines the standards regulating site changes for new and renovated buildings. Standards and requirements outline allowable density, building height, modulation, open space and sidewalk widths.  Chapter 5: Design GuidelinesInstructive design guidelines provide a framework for high-quality urban design, including building design and public open space. Chapter 6: Implementation ActionsOutlines the funding and financing options for implementing the Downtown Community Plan, and provides a comprehensive phasing recommendation for the combined actions. This chapter also describes the development cap and a monitoring program that will allow the City and community to evaluate the impact of Plan policies. AppendixThe build-out analysis developed for the Environmental Impact Report provides an understanding of what is likely to change over the next 20 years (Attachment D). This information is also captured in the interactive website: www.smgov.net/Departments/PCD/SeeDowntown2030/  Consistent with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and CEQA Guidelines, a Program Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was prepared for the DCP. The Program EIR analyzed the potential environmental effects associated with the DCP and identified mitigation measures necessary to reduce significant impacts.  Additionally, the Program EIR analyzes alternatives to the DCP, including a No Project Alternative and a Reduced Project (Tier 2 only) Alternative.  The Final EIR concludes that although there would be significant and unavoidable impacts, the DCP (with 3.2 million sf cap) would achieve the goals of No Net New PM Peak Hour Trips by 2030, and would reduce per capita vehicles miles traveled (VMT) and greenhouse gas emissions.", "other": "The Final Downtown Community Plan (Attachment A) presents a vision for Downtown Santa Monica that includes a prioritization for over 2,500 new housing units, as well as new public spaces, a further diversification of art and cultural offerings, a prominent role for historic preservation, and a multi-faceted approach to enhancing Downtowns pedestrian environment through building setbacks and improved streetscapes, to name but a few. Designed to be a relatively lower-scale 5-7 story Downtown, the DCP envisions that change will happen incrementally and be accompanied by infrastructure investments, including enhancements to the mobility network, that support the needs of a growing population.  Refining the LUCE VisionThe 2010 LUCE defined newly expanded boundaries for Downtown. The LUCE brought in all areas west of Lincoln Boulevard into the planning boundary to increase Downtowns footprint and to concentrate desired housing, jobs and community-serving uses near the terminus of the Expo light rail. Noting the inherent challenges faced by Downtown to maintain Santa Monicas small-town vibrancy and flavor, the LUCE directed the City and community to develop a Specific Plan to determine the appropriate range of building heights in the district and address the need for open space, affordable and workforce housing, pedestrian access from areas south of the Downtown core, the linkages from Downtown to the Beach and the incorporation of the Downtown Light Rail Station into the fabric of the Downtown. (LUCE Policy D14.1) After six years of Plan development, outreach and public discussions, the DCP has struck a balance to meet the challenges identified in the LUCE. The DCP creates the conditions for a lively pedestrian-oriented mix of uses and activities, including new housing options that are complemented by services and public spaces to create a complete neighborhood. It further strengthens Downtowns identity by safeguarding City designated historic resources and potential historic resources through a comprehensive preservation approach, and marries this to the creation of new landmarks that will spring from flexible development standards that inspire creativity and innovation at a scale that is consistent with Santa Monicas contemporary urban form. Lastly, the DCP continues to rely on the concept that pedestrians come first in Downtown Santa Monica. Addressing the full range of mobility in the Downtown relies on building on the investments already in place and strategic investment in infrastructure and programs to the meet the transportation needs of Downtown. As a comprehensive document, the DCP provides substantial policy guidance on all of the elements mentioned above, such that the Council and its Boards and Commissions will have a framework for making decisions about public investments, or judging the merit of proposals that are submitted by private individuals who wish to effect any manner of change Downtown. Significantly, the DCP also provides a suite of actions that the City itself will use to develop departmental and interagency workplans around infrastructure upgrades, public space enhancement, economic development, historic preservation, and mobility. These actions, implemented in coordination with a monitoring program that includes a cap on the volume of development evaluated under the Plans EIR, will guide city leaders to carefully steward the evolution of Downtown in a manner that is consistent with the long-term goals of the community for sustainability, resilience and well-being. This report summarizes the core components of the Downtown Community Plan and provides information on the substantive outreach process, as well as input from the Planning Commission and other Boards and Commission that have weighed-in on the final draft. For clarity, the report is organized into the following three chapters: 1.     THE DOWNTOWN COMMUNITY PLAN 2.     PLAN DEVELOPMENT AND FEEDBACK 3.     COUNCIL CONSIDERATIONS A.   Urban Design and Land Use StrategyFor the past century, Downtown Santa Monicas built environment has responded to various eras of change. From its infancy as a crossroads of commerce and civic life, to its present day role as bustling local hangout and job/tourist center Downtowns buildings stand as a record of human endeavor, and as a reflection of the zoning standards that each subsequent generation implemented to guide the urban form priorities of the day. This incremental approach is responsible for the great diversity of building heights Downtown, which range from one-story brick and mortar structures to taller twenty-one-story glass and steel buildings.  The DCP acknowledges the interplay between the old and new as a necessary ingredient to Downtowns authenticity, and presents an urban design strategy to safeguard the identifiable historic core within the Bayside Conservation District, and transfer unused development potential to the areas immediately served by the Expo Light Rail. The 5-7 story height profile proposed by the DCP is framed by 4-story transition zones that gradually reduce height and scale at Downtowns outer edges where it abuts the residential neighborhoods of Wilmont and Mid-City, and where views of the Pacific Ocean open up on Ocean Avenue. The development standards for the Plans six land use districts (Bayside Conservation, Neighborhood Village, Transit Adjacent, Lincoln Transition, Wilshire Transition, Ocean Transition) derive from the urban design strategy and provide equilibrium between the communitys desire to protect the historic scale of Downtowns central walking area centered on the Third Street Promenade with the need to accommodate additional residential and commercial activities in areas that are regionally connected by transit.  Land UseDowntowns vibrancy is attributed to its unique mix of shops, restaurants, offices, institutions, health and well-being centers, entertainment venues, markets, apartments, and dozens of other offerings that are used daily by locals, employees and visitors. As the expanded boundaries of Downtown begin to transition into a mixed-use environment, the DCP provides a logical structure for regulating land uses in a way that is complimentary to the urban design strategy by directing the most intensive pedestrian-oriented uses to the historic core and transit area, and limiting the presence of larger more regionally-sized commercial uses adjacent to residential areas. This framework supports the DCPs Land Use Regulations, which are finely-tuned to balance the Downtowns various roles as urban neighborhood, regional job center and visitor destination. Urban Form and Building DesignSanta Monica is renowned as a center of innovation and creativity, often leading the region - if not the nation  on issues of sustainability, community enrichment and urban policy. These practices are woven throughout many adopted City documents, such as the Zoning Ordinance, that influence building design both in our commercial areas as well as in our residential neighborhoods. In Downtown, the City has the opportunity to embody these principles in a new urban typology that celebrates architectural expression through flexible design standards. The DCP departs from the rigid formulas of the past several decades that have produced wedding cake buildings, and instead employs a suite of percentage-based modulation requirements that allow for an architectural concept to drive building design. These standards, which ensure a consistent pedestrian-scaled streetwall, interior access to light and air, and communal open spaces for building residents, provide designers with a comfortable canvas for exemplary architecture while empowering planners and reviewing bodies with sufficient criteria to evaluate the merit of individual projects. In response to comments received from the design community during the Planning Commissions deliberations on the draft DCP, avenues for alternative compliance or modifications to standards along with strategic exemptions from standards for single lot projects were added to the Planning Commissions recommended changes. The Architectural Review Board (ARB) discussed the Downtown Community Plan at both their June 5, 2017 and June 19, 2017 meetings and generally endorsed the urban design strategy and urban form approach. There was a robust exchange of ideas including discussion of design standards, modulation standards and design guidelines, the Bayside Conservation District and attention to potential historic resources and Landmark properties, open space provisions, as well as other aspects of the plan. The ARB Subcommittee also made many specific recommendations, identifying conflicts within the plan that needed clarification, and highlighting technical architectural items to be addressed with greater precision.  These items have been addressed in the staff-recommended Addenda (Attachment C). The ARB is generally supportive of the Downtown Community plan presented.  The ARB had a particular interest and concern regarding the modulation standards and were focused on ensuring the adopted standards do not prevent or hinder innovation and/or excellence in design.  To that end, the ARB would like to support the following implementation actions:          Add to Chapter 6, Implementation Actions a report on whether the development standards have resulted in desired outcomes. The change is recommended on Page 249, Item 5A, Enforcement of Project Entitlements, Review the design quality of downtown project to ensure diverse design typologies, innovation and quality design.         The Board strongly endorses the use of resources such as the Downtown Santa Monica Inc. Ambassador Program and outreach to private property owners regarding possible management partnerships to ensure successful outdoor spaces are incorporated into existing and new projects.         The Board also endorses the action to develop a Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District (NCOD) in the Bayside Conservation District (BSCD). Staff has added the ARBs proposed implementation action to the staff-recommended Addenda. Since the June ARB meetings, the Boards DCP subcommittee submitted a recommendation to add a special alternative stepback option for all Districts. The proposal would allow forms, geometries, and skins such as layered facades and brise-soleils that do not fit the modulation standards but generally conform to the intent for three-dimensional design and to ensure light and air into buildings and down to the street to be considered on a case-by-case basis through discretionary review. To this point, staff notes that the Plan already allows for architectural projections beyond the building frontage line for 2/3 of the faade and therefore, believes the forms and geometries contemplated by the ARB subcommittee would be accommodated within the Plans allowable projections.  The Downtown Community Plan is a Housing PlanThe Downtown Community Plans primary responsibility is to respond to the direction of the LUCE to encourage the growth of the residential population Downtown. This strategic land use emphasis is intended to accommodate the unmet demand for new housing in Santa Monica by directing the production of over 2,500 new units to an area that is rich with public transportation options and where higher densities can support a more sustainable development pattern. The primacy of housing development is highlighted in the DCP by policy and Plan standards that provide incentives to encourage the production of new housing units, both market-rate and affordable to people of lower incomes. The Housing Commission supports the DCPs approach to housing production. Housing Incentives         Floor Area Ratio (FAR) Bonus: housing projects have access to an additional 0.5 FAR bonus over commercial projects of a similar size.         Height Bonus on Lincoln and Wilshire Boulevards: housing projects on Lincoln and Wilshire Boulevard may achieve the maximum permitted height of the districts, whereas commercial projects are subject to a 10-foot reduction from the maximum permitted height.         PC RECOMMENDED: Process Incentives: entitlements for housing projects enjoy higher development review thresholds than their commercial counterparts. o       Housing projects up to 60,000 square feet (on lots no greater than 15,000 square feet) throughout the Downtown shall be processed through an Administrative Approval. o       Tier 3 housing projects up to 90,000 square feet in the Transit Adjacent District shall be processed through a Development Review Permit. Affordable Housing RequirementsIn addition to the housing incentives that are provided in the DCPs Standards and Regulations, affordable housing production will be stimulated by new requirements for Tier 2 and non-negotiated Tier 3 projects. These requirements were determined based upon feasibility analyses prepared by HR&A (Attachment I).         Uniform Affordable Housing Requirement by Height: the DCP proposes a modified framework for affordable housing, compared to existing regulations, that requires a single percentage of on-site or off-site housing, depending on the proposed height of the project.          Increased On-site Affordable Housing Requirements: the DCP requires a greater percentage of deed-restricted affordable units than currently required.         Augmented Off-Site Affordable Housing Requirements: projects that wish to satisfy their Affordable Housing requirement off-site of the market-rate project will be subject to an even higher percentage of deed-restricted affordable units than the on-site equivalent. Based on the Planning Commissions review of the DCP Affordable Housing proposal, the distance that an off-site project can be located from its related market-rate project has been expanded to anywhere within the Downtown, or within one-quarter mile of the market rate project.         Mandated Affordable Income Level Mix: based upon the proportionate household income levels in the Housing Element Regional Housing Needs Assessment and requirements of Proposition R, the revised DCP includes a new requirement to provide a mix of income levels within the total affordable units required for the project so that each project provides units affordable to extremely low, very low, low and moderate incomes. Exemptions for 100% Affordable Housing Projects         PC RECOMMENDED: Administrative Approval Threshold: 100% Affordable Housing projects up to 75 units may be approved administratively.         PC RECOMMENDED: Floor Area Ratio (FAR) Bonus: 100% Affordable housing projects in the Neighborhood Village have access to an additional 0.5 FAR bonus and 10 feet of additional height. The DCP projects an estimated minimum of 2,500 new units produced over the next 15-20 years, which represents a doubling of the residential population that emerged over the past three decades. Most of the new housing projects will include a healthy mix of unit sizes and affordability levels based on the DCPs policy direction and project requirements. It is important to note that 2,500 new units is a projection, not an absolute number, and could be increased upwards due to market forces that favor housing production over other land uses, such as commercial office or retail. The DCPs housing strategy and project requirements were reviewed by the Housing Commission at meetings on June 15, 2017 and June 20, 2017. The Housing Commission endorses most aspects of the DCPs housing approach including incentives for 100% affordable housing projects. However, the Housing Commission recommends that additional project or process requirements be contemplated further. Many of these recommendations include changes to proposed measures in the Plan including         Eliminating CUP requirement for SRO projects         Rejecting the process incentives for housing projects recommended by the Planning Commission         Prohibiting any offsite affordable housing within 500 feet of the I-10 freeway         Ensuring that the Housing Element Quantified Objective and Proposition R production requirements have been met before middle-income units (130%-180% AMI as indicated in DCP) could be considered in development agreement negotiations The inclusion of SRO projects as a permitted use is a change that will be reflected in the use table. The streamlined process for typical housing projects recommended by the Planning Commission was based on the need to create a clear and predictable process for housing projects as compared to commercial projects. To provide context to the location of offsite affordable housing, the Planning Commission discussed the limitation of residential uses within 500 feet of the I-10 freeway but did not impose any locational restrictions. Further, much of the Transit Adjacent district is within 500 feet of the I-10 freeway. Development agreement negotiations are conducted on a case-by-case basis so there would be no obligation to include any middle-income units. The Housing Commission also made several recommendations that extend beyond the scope of what has been in the public discourse or in proposals presented by staff or the community, including:         A graduated affordable housing requirement that escalates up to 35% based on allowable height and FAR thresholds         Eliminating any office or retail uses above the ground floor for new buildings, with exceptions for areas that the Council deems appropriate.         Applying project requirements (i.e. affordability mix and average bedroom factor) to offsite 100% affordable housing projects with an exemption from the requirements only if necessary to obtain other forms of public financing         Biennial review of DCP Affordable Housing and AHPP requirements to determine if new incentives or requirements should be instituted         Encouraging ground floor residential units to have a preference for low-income disabled persons and artists, subject to City Attorney review regarding any fair housing implications         Reviewing the entire AHPP now for consistency with Prop R income targeting and rent limits and revise the affordability requirements outside of Downtown based upon new feasibility studies similar to that conducted for the DCP         Increasing deed-restriction terms on affordable units from 55 years to the life of the project         Identifying publically-owned land as a potential resource to achieve affordable housing goals Staff appreciates the thoughtful detail that the Housing Commission put into their recommendations, some of which fall outside of the regulatory framework of the DCP in terms of deed restriction term limits and the framework of the AHPP.  Staff defers to Council on the subject of modified affordable housing requirements, but notes that a careful balance has been struck within the DCP between project requirements, fees, and process. Any recommendation must also be supported by the HR&A feasibility analysis. The elimination of office or retail space above the ground floor may appear attractive as a means to create housing projects but prohibiting office and retail above the ground floor must be carefully considered in balance with other uses that are vital to the Citys economy, social services network, or other important land uses that create a complete community.  The draft DCP proposes that offsite affordable housing projects must be owned in whole or part and operated by a non-profit housing provider. It is likely that these providers will seek public financing that will dictate the affordability requirements of the project, which is why the DCP exempts 100% affordable housing projects from the project requirements for Tier 2 and Tier 3 projects. However, there may be an instance where an offsite affordable housing project is completely privately financed. In this case, the project would still be required to comply with the definition of a 100% affordable housing project per Section 9.52.020.0050 of the Zoning Ordinance (25% of units affordable to 60% income households with remainder affordable to 80% income households). From a policy perspective, the net result is more affordable housing units and therefore, flexibility should be provided in how the offsite affordable housing is achieved. With respect to preference for artists, a new policy has also been included to explore accommodating artists within ground floor residential units provided the classifications do not result in unintended discriminatory impacts.  The DCP includes a monitoring requirement that would produce a report concurrent with the LUCE monitoring. The monitoring report would include data presented as part of the Proposition R annual reports. Staff does not support a requirement that the DCP affordable housing requirements be reviewed every two years as there may not be sufficient data points to inform such a study. The Preservation of Existing Buildings is Strongly SupportedPreserving the historic scale and character of Downtowns beloved walking areas is a central objective of the DCPs change strategy, which seeks to carefully retain many older structures that evoke nostalgia for Santa Monicas colorful past. The DCP improves upon previous historic preservation policies, and provides substantial support for adaptive reuse. A six-step approach outlines a variety of economic and technical incentives.  Adaptive Reuse IncentivesExemptions from standard development requirements have been added to the DCP that create economic and technical incentives for owners of properties identified as City Designated Historic Resources or as potential historic resources. Several examples include exemptions from development standards, such as parking, open space, and certain use regulations that would create barriers to adaptive reuse. It should be noted that other technical incentives are available such as the California Historical Building Code, which recognizes older buildings often need alternative methods in meeting fire and life safety requirements.  Protections for Historic ResourcesA new protection included in the DCP is an action to submit the Downtown Historic Resource Inventory (HRI) to the State Office of Historic Preservation, which would mean that all HRI-listed properties are considered presumptive historic resources under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). CEQA requires that exterior alterations to historic resources comply with the Secretary of the Interiors Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. If alterations are not in conformance or demolition is proposed, more detailed environmental review of the proposed project would be required, possibly including an Environmental Impact Report. Several new process changes are also included in the DCP to facilitate the conservation of City Designated Historic Resources and potential historic resources Downtown. These include modified demolition screening procedures that require Landmarks Commission review of demolition permits for structures more than 40 years old and clearance of the required 75-day waiting period before any Planning application can be submitted. This new procedure would serve as a means to identify potential historic resources prior to the submittal of an application, which would be complemented with an associated amendment to SMMC Article 8 (Building Regulations) to increase the lifespan for demolition applications. Future actions to support this process change include updating the Landmarks Ordinance to provide alternative pathways to designation and the creation of a Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District within the Bayside Conservation District to identify design features that provide visual identity to 2nd and 4th Streets. Special standards for the Bayside Conservation District include eliminating the open space requirements and relaxed modulation requirements in order to clearly define the traditional streetwall of 2nd and 4th Streets. The Landmarks Commission reviewed the DCPs approach to Historic Preservation at their June 12, 2017 meeting and supports the approach subject to the following recommended changes:         Specify possible funding sources for historic preservation         Assure that the existing provisions in the Municipal Code for expediting plan check occur in practice         Increase outreach and public education regarding historic preservation         Amend Policy HP2.4 to read, Adaptive reuse of older building should be considered for new construction and rehabilitation projects, when the scale, materials or method of construction evokes Downtowns history, and where the faade building contributes to a continuous streetscape.Staff supports the Landmarks Commissions recommendations and has added relevant changes to the recommended Addenda. Going forward, staff will continue to look for opportunities to realize existing incentives for historic preservation, and to help expand outreach on this subject.New Public and Open Spaces are Prioritized throughout DowntownBecause Downtown was largely developed as a commercial district it contains very few dedicated public spaces where groups can congregate. While many of the existing parks or public spaces that are utilized by Downtown residents and visitors are located nearby in other districts (e.g. Tongva Park, Palisades Park, Reed Park); within Downtown, only the public right of way, and places like the Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica Place, and the Santa Monica Main Library serve as Downtowns dedicated public open space offerings. Recognizing this, the community overwhelmingly identified the maintenance, enhancement or creation of public space as the #1 priority for Downtowns evolution.  The DCP looks at the public space network comprehensively, and acknowledges that a nuanced approach that involves both City and private interests must be considered. To this end, the Plan emphasizes the role that private development must play to add new public spaces to Downtown. The DCP identifies key sites where development has been proposed and where negotiations with property owners may yield significant public open space. Similarly, the Public Space plan includes existing publically-accessible spaces (POPs) that should be redesigned to promote better access and programming, perhaps incentivized with a small modicum of new floor area. Management and oversight of these spaces is paramount, and will require the involvement of City staff, DTSM and private property owners. Based on outreach, smaller scale public spaces such as pocket parks, courtyards and plazas are preferred over larger open spaces such as a central park or recreation fields. Additionally, the quality of Downtowns streetscapes is to be improved to emphasize their role as public spaces and the opportunity they provide to further pedestrianize the area through wider sidewalks, a larger more verdant urban forest, and street furnishings that would make the walking experience more enjoyable.  Private Open Space in Housing ProjectsA new feature of the DCPs zoning standards is the requirement for typical housing projects to provide on-site open space for residents use. Depending on the size of the project area, a project is required to dedicate 20-25% of the total lot area to courtyards, rooftop gardens, balconies and other open space types, and of this percentage one-quarter must be designed for communal use. Single-lot projects are exempt from these standards. The Recreation and Parks Commission (RPC) reviewed the DCPs Public Space approach at their December 15, 2016 meeting and subsequently provided a letter expressing unanimous support for the various approaches and policies surrounding the creation or enhancement of public open spaces Downtown. The RPC conditioned their support on several recommendations, including:          That the DCP maximize every opportunity to create open space, including true green space, courtyards, plazas and paseos;         That the DCP identify parcels that would be suitable for acquisition for open space use;         That the DCP include policies reflecting the need to work with private property owners to activate empty plazas;         That ground floor open space be included in all residential projects;         That projects subject to DAs provide substantial open space benefits and that property owners should be held accountable for maintaining open space amenities to the highest levels. Nearly all of the RPCs recommendations have been addressed and incorporated into the final draft DCP. The one exception is the recommendation to require ground floor open space, which was not integrated into the final plan as it would conflict with the broader urban design strategy to maintain a consistent streetwall at the ground floor. Encouraging Economic Vitality is Important to Downtowns FutureDowntown is a major employment center (approx. 25,000 jobs) and a revenue generator that supports the many programs, services and activities that residents citywide have come to enjoy. While constituting only 4.5% of the City, Downtowns generates over a third of the total sales tax revenues for Santa Monica, and another third of all hotel room revenues citywide. Additionally, fees collected from development to fund park maintenance, childcare programs, urban runoff projects, and transportation enhancements are largely drawn from projects located in Downtown. The combination of these elements has helped Downtown, and the city as a whole, weather challenging financial crises such as the Great Recession.  Given its prominence as Silicon Beach and a major tourist destination, one of Downtowns inherent tensions is the degree to which it caters to locals, employees and visitors alike. The challenge ahead is to ensure that it remains a place for everyone, and that opportunities for economic diversity are embraced. The DCP weaves together policies and standards that create a local business-friendly environment that can provide space for a broad mix of job opportunities in new and expanding industries whether they be creative office and co-working spaces, retail, dining and entertainment, or hospitality. The Promenade is further supported through a variety of exemptions from design standards to allow for greater flexibility, and through a change to several regulations that currently restrict uses. Going forward, an Action of the DCP is to work with Public Works and DTSM, Inc. on a Promenade improvement project to enhance its infrastructure, lighting and right-of-way features. In the course of outreach, a clear preference emerged to support the creative economy, and to expand opportunities for local entrepreneurialism with small and medium-sized businesses. To this end, the draft DCP includes a variety of changes from the zoning ordinance that are intended to reduce regulatory barriers for small businesses and typical changes of use. These include relaxed parking standards and less restrictive use regulations that ensure ground floor uses reflect the appropriate level of activity based on adjacency to residential uses.  The Downtown Santa Monica Inc. Board of Directors (DTSM) conducted a comprehensive review of the draft DCP and while there is agreement on many of the key approaches, there remains concern regarding the distribution of heights and densities across Downtown and the effect on housing production. DTSM highlighted six key recommendations for the Councils consideration:         Increase height and FAR in the BC and NV districts to 84 feet and FAR of 4.0 and to 60 feet and FAR of 2.75 for both sides of the Lincoln Transition district.         Provide streamlined process for granting flexibility from all aspects of retail space design and configuration standards to respond to the shifting retail environment.         Include a clear vision for a new state-of-the-art movie theater on the site of either Parking Structure #1 or #3.         Support for allowing ground floor office in midblock locations in the Neighborhood Village district as demand may not be sufficient to support retail in these locations resulting in vacancies detrimental to the neighborhood.         Include a clear statement on improvements to vehicle circulation with inclusion of a Vehicle Action Plan, similar in scope to Bike and Pedestrian Action Plans.         Consider flexibility in desired widths for sidewalk zones in order to accommodate space for outdoor dining. As discussed later in the report highlighting issues for Council consideration, policy options are presented to address housing production and ground floor office in Neighborhood Village midblock locations. The proposed heights and FARs in the Plan have been carefully crafted within the context of the urban design strategy to place the highest intensities closest to the Expo Station and to balance new development with the existing character of Downtown. DTSMs recommendations on a modification process for retail configuration are already included in the draft Plan. Language regarding support for movie theaters is also included in the Addenda. The sidewalk widths in the Plan are provided as conceptual illustrations and will be more comprehensively reviewed as part of the follow-up action to create a Downtown Streetscape Manual for how the public right-of-way is used and managed. As discussed in the following section, the Plan proposes a comprehensive Mobility approach that addresses improvements for all modes. A New Model for Mobility: Improving Today, Preparing for the FutureA new model for mobility includes making more transportation options attractive, convenient, affordable, and safer so that people feel they can circulate without driving alone. It is an evolution of how people get to Downtown, and how they experience traveling within Downtown. The creation of parking structures may have revived Downtown, Expo service has provided a new transit option, while the future is expected to include travel by driverless vehicles.  The park once, pedestrians first mantra has been a guiding tenet for the past 30 years in Downtown. Recently Expo light rail service, pedestrian scramble intersections, a bike center, bicycle lanes and bike share have been introduced to Downtown. The next phase will likely see more changes related to car service (Lyft, Uber, taxi), increasing demand for curb space, and technology. Success of the area is tied to the success of the pedestrian environment  continuing to be a place that residents and visitors both want to walk from place to place.  Transportation in Downtown is as diverse as the people who travel there. Downtown is a place that welcomes the service workers who make it function, as much as resident visitors and tourists  who may take a bus, ride the train, drive with friends, or take a tour bus. People come in buses, carpools, on foot and by bike and walk throughout the district. Providing a quality transportation experience requires flexibility to make it more effective for all of these roadway users. This includes measuring our performance in making streets serve people first, and prioritizing modes that are more efficient. A new focus in the DCP is the quickly-evolving technology influence on transportation, including electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles and transit service provided by private organizations. Since the inception of the development of this plan, car services, have gained widespread acceptance. The Citys response must be internal, by shaping choices so that the convenient option also meets community values, and external, by actively participating in the field of changing technology. The plan includes recommendations to work with businesses to provide micro-transit, to use technology to provide on-demand transit service, to focus on community priorities such as equitable access to autonomous vehicles, and to participate in regional transportation technology efforts. A new model for mobility requires changes to policies, new investments, different requirements for property owners, adapting business practices, and partnership with the Santa Monica community. Art and Cultural Offerings Create New Opportunities DowntownThe demand for new and more diverse art, cultural and entertainment activities is increasing Downtown. To establish Downtowns identity as a major cultural center, the City must carefully consider new opportunities for cultural engagement to stretch Downtowns vibrancy. Building from the traditionally retail-centered economic base, events, major artworks, unique creative expressions and live music will infuse the street and public spaces to strengthen Santa Monicas as a cultural destination. Additional entertainment choices Downtown, particularly nighttime venues, will provide residents, employees and visitors with a wider array of destination experiences than in the past, such as live performance spaces for theater and live music. The Arts Commission supports the DCPs approach to Art and Culture. The DCPs land use regulations now permit a larger range of art and cultural uses than historically permitted in the past. The Plan includes an invitation to potential museum operators to work with the City to locate a museum Downtown, and identifies several locations where major works of public art could be located. At its November 21, 2016 meeting the Arts Commission enthusiastically supported the inclusion of arts and culture into the DCP, and offered the several recommendations, which have largely been incorporated into the final Plan:           Encourage policies and public/private partnerships that promote robust artistic activities throughout downtown, in businesses, open spaces and vacant storefronts.          Support Creative Placemaking efforts that enhance other city goals, such as mobility and activating open spaces.          Wherever possible, the DCP should ease restrictions and streamline procedures to facilitate pop-up art interventions in underutilized spaces.          Encourage the development of public and public/private open space, and provide incentives for artists and arts groups to work with City Cultural Affairs staff to develop and implement art and Creative Placemaking programs downtown.          Position Downtown Santa Monica as a cultural destination          Expand options for live music and the performing arts in downtown facilities and businesses.          Of the affordable housing that is produced Downtown, 10% of the units should be designed and set aside for artist housing or live/work units.  The DCP directly addresses all of the recommendations of the Arts Commission through its policy framework and subsequent implementation actions with the exception of the Arts Commissions recent request that artist housing or live/work units be included as part of the DCPs affordable housing requirements. Additional refinements have been recorded in the recommended Addenda that reflect specific direction on certain actions. Community Wellbeing The Citys Wellbeing Project looks beyond traditional performance measures or economic indicators and uses a new method to gain an understanding of how all of these factors interact and affect residents quality of life. The core of the project is the Wellbeing Index, which provides the City with a snapshot of its current wellbeing strengths and needs by analyzing data collected from residents, city departments and social media to gain a robust understanding of how the people of Santa Monica are doing across multiple measures known to influence wellbeing.  The Wellbeing Index demonstrates that Downtown residents benefit from many positive dimensions, such as access to healthy food, proximity to culturally enriching experiences and institutions, use and enjoyment of Downtowns outdoor spaces, and frequent use of the many mobility options provided. However, the Index also points to areas of concern that highlight the growing pains of a residential neighborhood in its infancy. The metrics for stress, stability and life/work balance all register slightly higher Downtown than any other neighborhood in the city. One indicator of particular concern to the planning team reveals that Downtown residents do not feel connected to one another in the way that fosters community, trust among neighbors, and social interaction. Tying the results of the Index to Plan policies and standards strengthens the logic for prioritizing affordable housing, public open space, new neighborhood serving uses, youth and senior services, and many others.  The Social Services Commission submitted their recommendations to the Planning Commission on April 26, 2017. Specifically, the Social Services Commission recommended the use of the Wellbeing Project data to guide development agreement negotiations and be used as a tool to advance a diverse and multigenerational Downtown community, support for affordable housing, and specificity for policies supporting wraparound community and social services to serve the Downtown community. Recommendations that development projects include setasides for affordable/low-cost office space and community rooms could not be included due to lack of nexus between such requirements and new development; however, such amenities could be included in negotiated projects. Many of the Social Services Commissions recommendations were included in the Planning Commissions final recommendation on the DCP.B.   IMPLEMENTING AND MONITORING THE PLAN Implementation of the DCP will be a shared responsibility. Chapter 6 outlines all actions in the Plan along with a relative estimate of cost, responsibility, timing, and potential funding sources (Table 6.1 of the draft Plan). This can used as a budgeting tool and also as a means to support grant applications. Table 6.1 demonstrates that implementation of the DCP will be a shared responsibility dependent on not only City leadership but also coordination with community partnerships and cooperation from private entities.  The DCP monitoring report will be prepared concurrent with the LUCE 5-year Measuring and Monitoring Report. One key area that will be monitored is the development cap of 3.2M square feet of net new floor area in Downtown. This development cap represents the amount of new development that could occur that would still allow achievement of the LUCE goal of No Net New PM Peak Hour Trips. Any project proposal that exceeds the cap would not be able to be approved until additional environmental analysis and amendments have been completed. There are also other indicators to monitor the performance of the DCP listed on Page 247-249 of the draft Plan. A.   COMMUNITY OUTREACHMany years of outreach have marked the development of the DCP. Interdepartmental staff and the planning team have worked with community stakeholders and the Citys Boards and Commissions to tackle challenging issues in search of consensus, and have listened intently to the perspectives brought forward by the many voices involved in shaping the Plan. Beginning in 2012, outreach on the DCP has taken on many forms, from workshops on Emerging Themes, Community Benefits, and Urban form, to stakeholder interviews and meetings with the Planning Commission and City Council. In total, seven workshops were held to drill into Plan concepts and generate feedback from the community. At the onset of 2016, staff re-engaged the community on a variety of topics to move closer towards consensus and to refine the Plan. 2016 Outreach and EngagementBeginning shortly after the Planning Commissions March 2nd, 2016 meeting, staff launched an unprecedented outreach campaign to community groups and local organizations, employing the Citys Office of Communications as a partner in diversifying the input opportunities and in reaching new voices within the community. The outreach tools and platforms used to engage thousands of people were expansive and yielded greater detail about the communitys preference for things like open space, art and culture, mobility, jobs and housing and historic preservation. Importantly, the outreach also demonstrated that there are a great many perspectives on height, development and planning for large sites that have the ability to support much desired amenities.  A detailed breakdown of the 2016 outreach and supporting documentation is provided in the November 16, 2016 Planning Commission staff report. Below is a snapshot of last years outreach by the numbers:          1,200 people provided feedback on Downtown priorities in workshops, focus groups and online         Over 40 community presentations were given to local groups and organizations in both English and Spanish          7 community conversation focus groups were held at the Main Public Library and at Senior Residences Downtown         3 public workshops were held on the subjects of Placemaking, Preservation and Change and Mobility         3 Downtown walking tours were co-hosted by the planning team and the Santa Monica Conservancy         4.6 million social media impressions were recorded on facebook, twitter and instagram         8,700 unique visits to the DCP website, www.downtownsmplan.org Leading up to the release of the 2017 Final Draft Downtown Community Plan, staff held several events to provide a broad overview into the content of the Plan and to establish a rapport with interested community members who sought clarifications on key subjects or who had questions about the collective vision for Downtowns future. B.   ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS In accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a Program Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was prepared that analyzed the potential environmental effects associated with the DCP. The Draft Program EIR was circulated for a 90 day public review period beginning on February 3, 2016 (exceeding the minimum 45-day public review as required by Section 15067 of the CEQA Guidelines). In addition, a Recirculated Draft EIR was circulated for a 45-day public review period in February 2017 to reflect changes that were made to the draft DCP. Comments on the Draft EIR and Recirculated Draft EIR included public concerns about development in Downtown, the Miramar established large site, height, traffic, aesthetics, and neighborhood character. The Final EIR provides written responses to all comments received on the Draft EIR and Recirculated Draft EIR. Some minor text changes and clarification were also included in the Final EIR. The Final EIR analyzes the effect of potential land use changes that could occur in the Downtown through 2030 as a result of the implementation of the DCP, including review of the range of impacts between two different buildout scenarios. Scenario A (High Scenario) would entail higher FARs for sites in the Downtown with variation by district, and represents the City Councils outside parameters for EIR analysis established during the August 13, 2013 meeting, which includes FARs up to 5.0 for the established large sites. Scenario B has a lower range of FARs, with up to 4.0 FAR for the established large sites. Scenario B represents a maximum cap of 3.22 million sf of net new floor area in the Downtown. The Final EIR identifies significant and unavoidable impacts for air quality, construction effects, construction noise, cultural resources, and traffic. Specifically because the details of specific future projects occurring in the Downtown are unknown, the Final EIR concludes that construction-related air emissions and noise (vibration) would be significant and unavoidable. Furthermore, although the DCP would establish greater preservation policies and standards, the Final EIR concludes that historic impacts would be significant and unavoidable since individual projects could involve the demolition or alteration of a historic resource. Additionally, due to the Citys stringent thresholds for traffic and the existing levels of traffic in Downtown, the Final EIR identifies significant and unavoidable impacts with respect to traffic (automobile delay). Aesthetic impacts of the DCP, including those due to building height, are considered less than significant pursuant to Section 21099 of the CEQA Statute, which states that aesthetic impacts of residential, mixed use, and employment center projects in transit priority areas are considered less than significant.  Most importantly, the Final EIR concludes that Scenario B of the DCP (with 3.2 million sf cap) would achieve the goals of No Net New PM Peak Hour Trips by 2030, and would reduce per capita vehicles miles traveled (VMT) and greenhouse gas emissions, which is consistent with the intent of SB743 and upcoming changes to CEQA. Additionally, as noted in the Final EIR, the DCP implements the sustainability and greenhouse gas reduction goals and policies established in the Citys LUCE, Sustainable City Plan, Climate Action Plan, and SCAGs Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy. The DCP is based on a vision of supporting and enhancing the Downtown as a multi-modal district that is fully integrated with the Downtown Station of the Expo LRT. The DCP also emphasizes new land uses in areas proximate to the Downtown Station to minimize vehicle trip generation, vehicle miles traveled, and associated GHG emissions. Additionally, the Plan would enhance multi-modal relationships, calling for new connections and circulation improvements for all modes as well as aggressive TDM measures such as employer trip reduction plans and subsidized transit passes or transportation allowances for residents and employees. Collectively, the standards, policies, and programs in the DCP would support sustainability and GHG reduction goals established by the State, region, and City. As required under CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(a), the Final EIR includes a discussion and evaluation of \"a reasonable range of alternatives to the project, or to the location of the project, which would feasibly obtain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project, and evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives.\" The EIR provides a robust analysis of the DCP as well the following alternatives. The alternatives analysis provides City decision-makers with a reasonable range of alternatives to consider to reduce or avoid impacts.         Alternative 1  No Project Alternative;          Alternative 2  Reduced Project (Elimination of Tier 3) Alternative;          Alternative 3  4th/5th Streets On-Way Streets Circulation Plan;          Alternative 4  Expanded One-way Streets Circulation Plan; and          Alternative 5  Hotel/Tourism-focused Land Use Mix Alternative.  CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6 requires that an EIR identify the Environmentally Superior Alternative to the proposed project from among the alternatives analyzed. If the No Project Alternative is found to be environmentally superior alternative, the EIR also identifies an Environmentally Superior Alternative from among the other alternatives. For a broad policy document such as the DCP, the potential exists that there may not be a clear Environmentally Superior Alternative. An alternative may have some reduced impact levels and other impacts that are greater than the project, while another alternative reduces different impacts. Although CEQA does not provide specific guidance in this matter, where a project has lower impacts in a majority of resource areas and/or substantially lower impacts in especially critical resource areas, this can support a finding that that alternative is environmentally superior.  Alternative 2 (Elimination of Tier 3 Projects) would reduce transportation-related impacts on intersections; however, elimination of Tier 3 developments would substantially reduce community benefits and substantial affordable housing and multi-modal transportation investment opportunities within the Downtown, potentially resulting in increased vehicles miles traveled. Therefore, in comparing an incremental reduction in the severity of significant impacts with the achievement of Project goals and objectives, the EIR determined that the implementation of Scenario B of the DCP would be the environmentally superior alternative. Implementation of Scenario B would incrementally reduce potential environmental impacts relative to Scenario A, but implementation of Scenario B would also still achieve all of the goals and objectives of the DCP. The Final EIR was presented to Planning Commission for review in April 2017, who recommended certification of the Final EIR. Adoption of the DCP would require Council certification of the Final EIR, and adoption of a Statement of Overriding Considerations and the mitigation measures identified in the Final EIR. Mitigation measures are identified in the Final EIR in the areas of Air Quality, Biological Resources, Construction Effects (Air Quality), Cultural Resources, Hazards/Hazardous Materials, Public Services, Utilities, and Transportation and Circulation. To ensure that these measures are properly enacted, a mitigation monitoring program is necessary and will be enforced during the construction and operation of the project.  C.   PLANNING COMMISSION COMMENTS ON THE PLANDuring the months of April and May 2017 the Planning Commission held six public hearings to discuss the DCP (April 25, May 10, May 11, May 17, May 18 and May 31) and its Program Environmental Impact Report. These meetings, which spanned over 40 hours of discussion, also provided the opportunity for the community to comment on the Plans content, and for staff to clarify concepts. The Commission recommended adoption of the DCP with specific amendments and modifications that are listed in Exhibit B to the adopting resolution (Attachment B). The modifications largely pertain to key development standards and Plan policy that encourage the production of housing, as well as the range and location of land uses that are desired for the area. Housing ProductionAmong the productive clarifications to design standards, mobility actions, open space creation and well-being targets, the Planning Commissions most impactful recommendations were to increase several housing-related process thresholds to further stimulate housing production Downtown. Hence, the Commission has recommended that typical mixed-use housing projects up to 60,000 square feet, on lots no greater than 15,000 square feet, be processed ministerially through an Administrative Approval, which would greatly reduce the time necessary to process a development application. In the Transit Adjacent District, the only area in Downtown that has a Tier 3 option, the Commission recommends a Development Review Permit process for housing projects up to 90,000 square feet. This process threshold represents the amount of maximum allowable floor area that could result from a project located on a three-lot site of 22,500 square feet. The Planning Commissions recommendation was based on overall consensus that this area can support greater densities on account of proximity to the Expo Light Rail. Comparison of DCP to Planning Commission recommendations for Housing Project Review ProcessLess than 30,000 SFProject on lots up to 15,000 SF (typically results in projects less than 60,000 SF) All Tier 2 Tier 3 30,000 - 60,000 SFTier 2 on lots over 15,000 SF Tier 3 on lots over 15,000 SF and up to 90,000 SFTier 3 over 60,000 SFTier 3 over 90,000 SF Established Large Site Standards and ProcessLastly, the Commission spent considerable time discussing the DCPs options for the Established Large Sites, three sites within Downtown that - given their parcel size - could potentially provide significant community benefits for circulation, open space and cultural facilities that would otherwise not be anticipated from smaller projects. The inclusion of these sites into the Plan sparked the most extensive and spirited debate among Planning Commissioners. There was consideration of various modifications to the staff recommendation. In the end, without majority support for any particular approach to these sites, the Commission narrowly recommended (4-3 straw vote) the removal of the Established Large Site Overlay, which provides unique height and FAR standards for these sites.  Commissioners who favored including the Established Large Site Overlay sought to establish the DCP as a comprehensive planning tool that creates clear parameters and expectations for projects on the three sites. The Commissioners also supported a transparent and rigorous public review process that requires a development agreement, additional environmental review, and includes special application requirements for the applicant to demonstrate how the project meets the DCPs objectives. The Commission discussed potentially reducing the maximum height to approximately 100 feet with a setback from Ocean Avenue. These Commissioners expressed concern about reviewing Specific Plan amendments for individual projects soon after adoption of the DCP. Commissioners who did not favor including the Established Large Site Overlay supported having the height and FAR standards in Chapter 4, Table 4.2 apply to all Downtown projects. These Commissioners expressed concern that District height limits should not be exceeded and authorizing greater height and FAR in the Plan would signal that increased height is acceptable. There was a desire to ensure that the appropriate form in Downtown is established first through the DCPs base standards and not influenced by community benefits and project amenities. These Commissioners agreed that applicants for each project should submit Specific Plan Amendments for review on a project-by-project basis.  Similarly, the Commission rejected a selection of process options that would have required voter approval or a supermajority of Council to effect changes to the adopted DCP. The Commission was nearly unanimous (6-1 straw vote) in the belief that Council authority is sufficient to render decisions related to Plan amendments, and that the referendum process established in State law provides appropriate opportunities for voters to challenge Councils legislative actions. Access and MobilityThe Planning Commission has actively provided feedback on the Access and Mobility chapter specific actions and overall approach. Following discussion with the Commission, the Plan now calls for preparing for emerging technologies that serves the communitys vision, strengthens the plans consistency with Vision Zero, and updates parking policies that the Commission has since suggested amending. The Commission strongly communicated a desire to not only be forward-thinking but aggressive with implementation, as reflected in the errata sheet recommended by the Commission.  The DCP addresses steps to ensure how technology can best be used to make Downtowns existing transportation network work better for people. The Plan includes an approach to making travel information easier to access through real-time information for transit service, bike share availability, travel times, and parking availability. A methodological use of information on parking and travel patterns can also be used to plan for and manage peak travel periods, which allow for having the right amount of people working at the right times to assist travelers and deployment of the most effective changes needed during peak travel periods. Technology is increasing the viability of shared rides, microtransit or privately owned transit, autonomous vehicles, and widespread acceptance of electric vehicles. The DCP provides direction on how technology can be integrated with transportation in Downtown and how Santa Monica can participate in guiding the development of these technologies in the region.  ParkingClimate change, traffic congestion, and changing usage patterns necessitate shifting parking policies. The Commission has affirmed the right-sizing and right-placing by having a discreet amount of new parking primarily on the periphery of Downtown. There has also been support for studying and then supporting private parking availability for the public.  Parking related changes suggested to Council by the Planning Commission include:         Creating a new parking district in the Zoning Ordinance specifically for the Downtown that supports preservation of buildings through greater flexibility when a use changes. The DCP parking requirements recommend a universal parking rate of 1 space per 500 square feet for all retail and restaurant uses under 5,000 square feet, parking rates are similarly adjusted for residential units. (Zoning Ordinance Amendments)         Enabling the phased development of up to 800 public parking spaces in peripheral locations to address future demand without incentivizing additional vehicle trips downtown (Action AM3.6C)         Pursuing the elimination of 600 public parking spaces within the Bayside Conservation District within 10 years of adoption of the plan. (New AM3.6 Action)         Re-evaluating private parking requirements after 1,500 new parking spaces have been entitled (Action AM3.5G)         Establishing demand-sensitive variable parking pricing, time-limits and marketing. (AM3.6A)         Encouraging use of convenient parking for short-term use through pricing and time restrictions, including installation of meters on 6th and 7th Streets. (new AM3.6B)         Completing the expansion of the Parking In-Lieu Fee program to include all properties in the DCP boundaries by 2019. (Action AM4.5F)         Requiring that new public parking must be built entirely outside of the Bayside Conservation District, including on projects that may overlap with that district, such as the city-owned 4th/5th/Arizona site (new AM3.6 action) The Planning Commission also made a number of recommendations in regards to bicycling, walking and resident access including aggressive implementation timelines. Specific recommendations include:          Creation of protected bike facilities on Ocean Avenue, 2ne Street, and Broadway (Action AM4.3B)         Minimizing the closure of bike and pedestrian facilities due to construction and providing clear and direct alternates when closure is necessary. (Actions AM1.2E and AM1.2F)         Pursuing the creation of a Santa Monica resident transportation pass or credit usable for select mobility services and parking access Downtown, especially during off-peak periods. (Action 4.1K) A.   SPOTLIGHT ISSUES FOR COUNCIL CONSIDERATIONThis section of the report identifies several spotlight issues for Council consideration that were raised in the course of the Planning Commissions deliberations on the DCP. The DCP provides for ample housing production over the life of the Plan through a variety of process and technical incentives that are designed to steer development towards the creation of new residential units. These incentives include a .5 FAR bonus for housing projects over their commercial counterparts, as well as some additional height in the transition zones. Coupled with project requirements for new Affordable Housing, the DCP housing production incentives create the condition to achieve the forecasted minimum of 2,500 new units within the next 15 years. The possibility for additional square footage for housing exists within the volume of development contemplated in the Plans EIR, potentially adding up to roughly 3,100 new units if less commercial, medical or institutional uses are proposed than originally forecasted. Recent criticism of the DCPs housing approach has raised the specter of the nationwide housing crisis with many proponents demanding higher heights and densities than currently proposed or even studied in the EIR. Public testimony and correspondence point to a sentiment that Santa Monica must do more to provide housing to those in need, even though the City is well on track to achieve or surpass its Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) number given by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), and that Downtown has the highest allowable FARs in the entire City. During the Planning Commission hearings, the Commission recommended several process and technical incentive changes that fast-track housing projects Downtown, such as an Administrative Approval process for typical two-lot projects that typically result in projects of approximately 5-6 stories and 60 units. The Commission also recommended a more permissive administrative threshold for 100% Affordable Housing projects and height and FAR increases for 100% Affordable Housing in the Neighborhood Village District. For Council Consideration: Should the Council wish to go beyond the DCPs recommended housing-first strategy, the following options are presented for consideration:Option 1: Increase process thresholds by which more housing projects would qualify for streamlined entitlements.Option 2: Further reduction in height and FAR for commercial projects (e.g. 10 and 0.5 FAR).Option 3: Require all projects on sites of greater than 15,000 square feet to have at least 50% of the floor area be residential uses, except for hotels, movie theaters, auto dealers, public infrastructure, and the Third Street Promenade.Option 4: Increasing the height and FAR standards, subject to additional environmental evaluation  Table of Supporting and Opposing Arguments for Each Policy Alternative1         Provides significant time incentives for developers to seek housing         Creates certainty for community and developer         Perception of reduction in opportunities for public participation2         Would clearly establish preference for housing projects by further reducing height and FAR for commercial projects         Overall reduction in height and FAR for commercial projects was done for neighborhood transitions but implementing this strategy in Downtown core could have unintended consequence of affecting Downtown economic vitality3         Guarantees that any larger project would be required to have 50% residential use, prohibiting strictly office and retail projects (exempting hotels, movie theaters, auto dealers, public infrastructure, and buildings on the Third Street Promenade.         Blanket standard that prescribes land use mix and reduces flexibility in land use decisions          Proscriptive approach instead of providing incentives4         Could result in potentially more than 2,500 new housing units if FAR standards are increased         Would not result in substantially more housing units         Inconsistent with urban design strategy proposed in DCP and widely discussed and endorsed by the community Staff RecommendationStaff recommends further process incentives be considered as described in Option 1, as they would provide clear project requirements with predictable timelines established in DCP. The Planning Commission recommended that an Administrative Approval process would be appropriate for projects on sites no greater than 15,000 square feet. The Commission also recommended that a Development Review Permit would be appropriate for Tier 3 projects no greater than 90,000 square feet in the Transit Adjacent District. This was intended to allow typical housing projects that are similar in size and scale to housing projects that already exist in the Downtown leaving larger projects subject to Planning Commission review.  As a further process incentive, Council could establish a higher threshold for Administrative Approvals (AA) that would provide predictability to applicants with respect to number of housing units authorized, amount of affordable housing units required, affordability level of units, open space requirements, and certainty in applicable development standards. The Administrative Approval (AA) process provides certainty that the project will be approved if it meets all of the DCPs project requirements. This class of housing projects would be required to obtain a recommendation from the ARB before the AA could be approved and would still need to obtain final approval on the project design from the ARB. This process is similar to the procedural incentives that were formerly in place for Downtown in the 1990s that resulted in the production of approximately 2,500 housing units over the course of three decades. The significant difference is the DCP has a variety of development standards in place that are intended to ensure that projects not only complement Downtowns existing character but also contribute to the implementation of Downtown as a vibrant, walkable place that welcomes a diverse population of all income levels. The Planning Commissions narrow recommendation to remove the Established Large Site Overlay from the DCP points to the divergence of opinions surrounding tall buildings in Downtown Santa Monica. Outreach to the community on this subject was balanced at opposite ends, with roughly 50% in favor and another 50% opposed. Those in favor of the Overlay, which would allow three projects to propose building heights up to 130 within an established planning framework, argued that the potential benefits for open space, historic preservation, and mobility outweighed potential negative impacts associated with shade/shadow and scale. Those opposed to the Overlay expressed concern that Santa Monicas identity as a low-scale coastal community would be compromised by tall buildings, and further  that the DCPs standards should reflect a level playing field for all development, and not single out a few exceptions. For Council Consideration: Should the DCP include the Established Large Site Overlay, which would authorize consideration of height up to 130 feet and additional FAR on three sites in Downtown? Staff Recommendation on Height for Established Large SitesThe concept of the Established Large Site Overlay presented in the draft DCP seeks to establish clear expectations in terms of maximum height, appropriate FAR, and open space requirements for three sites in Downtown. The proposal also establishes a rigorous review process that requires a development agreement application and includes additional environmental review and a comprehensive application that demonstrates how the project meets DCP priorities. No Specific Plan Amendment would be required. As legislative actions, development agreements would be subject to the voter approval process already established in State law. Staff believes that there are site-specific reasons why allowing for additional height would lead to superior outcomes for future development on these sites. Staff also believes that imposing a clear maximum height for future projects on those sites provides clarity and coherence to protect the integrity of the overall plan that would be absent if property owners/developers could seek consideration for essentially unlimited heights for projects on those sites  or could seek additional heights on sites where positive trade-offs simply do not apply. Allowing the projects to move forward with the 130 height would allow flexibility for more ground level public space, preservation of historic buildings and features (currently on two of the three sites) and the opportunity for more distinctive and functional architectural massing, modulation and design.  Options for Established Large Site Floor Area Ratio (FAR)Each of the Established Large Sites have individual FAR parameters, which dictate the mass and scale of the projects. While the proposed height of these projects has been the focus of discussions, the projects FARs also have the potential to directly influence the project and community benefits that could be achieved on these three sites. Should Council seek options for exploring revised FARs for these sites, staff proposes three options for consideration:Option 1: Maintain the DCPs existing individual FAR parameters for the Established Large Sites, which were originally presented in the 2014 version of the DCP, and in all subsequent drafts leading up to the final DCP. Were this option to be adopted, it would reflect the original development parameters that have been consistently discussed throughout the multi-year public process of creating the DCP and the proposals that have been submitted to the City by the applicants.Option 2: Modify the DCPs FAR parameters such that all three Established Large Sites would be subject to a universal 3.0 FAR, which represents an average of the development potential across all three sites provided by the DCPs base development standards for each Zoning District. Were this option to be adopted, it would reduce development potential for two of the three sites and ensure that the development of all three Established Large Sites would not exceed the theoretical development potential of the total land area of all three sites were these parcels developed in a series of typical two- or three-lot projects as opposed to the larger block-level projects that have been proposed.Option 3: Modify the DCPs FAR parameters such that the FAR for each of the three sites would be limited to the maximum FAR established for each Zoning District averaged across the whole site. Were this option to be adopted, it would reduce development potential for two of the three sites, which in turn may limit certain aspects of the proposed projects. Comparison between three FAR options for the Established Large Sites1133 Ocean Avenue 191,664 sfFAR=3.0   FAR=3.0FAR: 2.75 (OT)[AVG = 2.75 FAR] 191,664 x 2.75 = 527,076 sf101 Santa Monica Blvd82,500 sfFAR=4.0    FAR=3.0FAR: 3.5 (BC) Split Zone 2.75(OT)[AVG = 3.0 FAR] 31,010 x 3.5 = 108,535 sf51,490 x 2.75 = 141,598 sf4th/5th and Arizona112,000 sfFAR=3.5    FAR=3.0FAR: 3.5 (BC) Split Zone 3.25 (NV)[AVG = 3.4 FAR] 56,000 x 3.5 = 196,000 sf56,000 x 3.25 = 182,000 sf If the Established Large Site Overlay is not included in the DCP, the three sites would be required to comply with the height and FAR standards established in the development standards table. Where there are split zones, the separate development standards for the portion of the property within each applicable zoning district would apply. As a result, applicants would need to submit Specific Plan Amendments for each individual project. Because the DCP takes a housing-first approach, commercial office uses in Downtowns active and transitional areas are limited predominantly to upper floors or at the rear of a project. The one area of the Downtown where commercial offices are permitted at the ground floor is in the Neighborhood Village District, where many existing ground floor offices, such as the Chamber of Commerce, are currently located. At its final hearing on the DCP, the Planning Commission voted to recommend that commercial office in the Neighborhood Village be limited to upper floors or at the rear of a project. Staff is concerned that this recommendation will render many existing offices non-conforming. Additionally, staff is concerned that there is not enough retail demand to justify the elimination of ground floor office (which includes walk-in clientele), and could have the unwelcome effect of producing vacant storefronts.  For Council Consideration: Should the Planning Commissions recommendation to eliminate all ground floor office from the Plan be adopted? If not, the following option is recommended by staff: Staff RecommendationBased on an existing land use survey of the Neighborhood Village District, offices currently make up approximately 45% of the ground floor street frontage. The Planning Commissions recommendation would make all of these ground floor uses non-conforming and replace them with potentially residential or retail uses as change occurs. A 2015 Downtown market outlook report that was used as a point of comparison for the Buildout Analysis demonstrated limits to the amount of retail space that could be feasibly supported in the DCP boundaries. The land use strategy in the DCP establishes the Neighborhood Village District as an area of mixed activity where non-active uses such as residential and office uses could be allowed on the ground floor in mid-block locations only. More active retail and restaurant spaces are strategically targeted for corner locations. The existing retail spaces in these mid-block locations have historically been difficult to lease and the ground floor non-active uses would likely have better compatibility with the residential uses that are anticipated in the district. B.   AMENDMENTS TO RELATED DOCUMENTS Various associated amendments to the Land Use and Circulation Element, Civic Center Specific Plan, and Zoning Ordinance are necessary to implement the goals and policies of the draft DCP. Upon receiving direction from Councils deliberations on the Plan, staff anticipates bringing these associated resolutions and ordinances to Council for formal action on July 25, 2017. LUCE AmendmentThe LUCE is proposed to be amended to reflect the elimination of Tier 3 on Lincoln Boulevard and within the Wilshire Transition district. CCSP AmendmentThe CCSP is proposed to be amended to remove the Colorado Avenue Special Use District. This change is necessary to eliminate overlap and the potential for conflicting regulations between the DCP and CCSP boundaries. Zoning Ordinance AmendmentsThe DCP will be incorporated by reference into the Zoning Ordinance. Where there is a conflict between the Zoning Ordinance and DCP, the DCP shall prevail. Where the DCP is silent, the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance shall apply. There are also a number of zoning ordinance amendments that are associated with the DCP that are being proposed to complement the standards of the draft DCP. These include the following:          Fence, Wall, Hedge height limits  establish fence, wall and hedge standards within the Downtown Community Plan area         Demolition Requirements  requires that demolition application screening and 75-day period are cleared before an application may be accepted for filing         Parking o       Establish parking maximumso       New parking requirementso       Incorporate parking in-lieu fee         Outdoor dining standards  clarify the name of the outdoor dining standards and clarify that the City Manager may promulgate guidelines necessary to implement outdoor dining requirements Associated with the above Zoning Ordinance amendments are anticipated amendments to Division 6 (Land Use and Zoning Related Provisions) and Article 8 (Building Regulations). These include a 100% transportation allowance for nonresidential projects and nonresidential components of mixed-use projects based upon Downtowns higher average vehicle ridership (AVR) target of 2.2 and voter approval procedures for development agreements, if applicable. An amendment to SMMC Section 8.08.060 is proposed to extend the expiration time limits for demolition applications to accommodate the new demolition review procedures. These proposed amendments are attached to this staff report to inform Councils consideration of the DCP. ", "background": "The Downtown Community Plan is a roadmap guiding the evolution of Downtown Santa Monica, a 229-acre area identified by the Citys Land Use and Circulation Element (LUCE) as bounded by Wilshire Boulevard and the I-10 Freeway, and between Lincoln Boulevard and Ocean Avenue. Taking into account that only 4% of the City lies within Downtown (roughly half a square mile), the DCP lays out a framework that integrates housing, jobs, mobility, historic preservation, public open space, infrastructure, and art and culture into a comprehensive long-term Plan. When adopted, the DCP will guide decision-makers and City departments, property owners and developers, as well as local stakeholder groups who provide services and programs to benefit the health and vitality of Downtown Santa Monica and all those who live, work or play here.Creation of the DCPThe path that the DCP has taken to get to this final phase began with the adoption of the LUCE in 2010. The LUCE set forth goals and policies for an expanded Downtown and called for a Specific Plan (the DCP) to propose strategies and standards to create the conditions for a sustainable urban lifestyle. This vision included expanding cultural arts offerings, and adding both intimate and larger open spaces to the growing residential community. The vision addressed traffic, congestion and pedestrian safety by suggesting upgrades to streetscapes, optimizing the circulation network and integrating the Expo Light Rail into the physical fabric of the community in order meet the needs of all people navigating the Downtown. Priority was assigned to public improvements that would enhance the pedestrian experience and to standards and programs that would foster trip reduction by encouraging transit, walking, and biking as well as Transportation Demand Management (TDM) measures. The planning effort has been guided by substantial community participation and the involvement of the Citys Boards and Commissions, including the City Council. Throughout the workshops and discussions, public hearings and events, stakeholders have worked assiduously to shape the DCP into a balanced framework that supports residents, business owners, employees, non-profits, property owners and other community stakeholders. Since initiating the planning process in 2012, several iterations of the DCP have been introduced, including:          September 2013: Downtown Specific Plan Framework. This document included a compilation of the primary components of the Plan including all of the issues that had been discussed to that date. The Framework became the basis of a project description for the Program Environmental Impact Report.         February 2014: Draft Downtown Specific Plan. The first release of a comprehensive Downtown Specific Plan came a year later, adding greater detail to the concepts included in the Framework, and weaving together regulatory proposals with policy. The Draft Downtown Specific Plan underwent a major revision and restructuring process in winter 2016.         February 2016: Draft Downtown Community Plan. The second full-length version of the Plan was released in February 2016 under a new title of Downtown Community Plan. This effort was conducted to recognize the overarching desire to nurture a long-term community within Downtowns boundaries, and to make sure that every Santa Monica resident feels welcome in the Downtown. The revision included an overhaul of the document that resulted in reformatting, reorganization, and text streamlining. The Plan was also made more action-oriented, tying key initiatives to phasing periods and responsible parties both within and outside City government.         April 2017: Final Public Hearing Draft Downtown Community Plan. The final Public Hearing version of the Plan was released on April 12th at a public event at the Civic Centers East Wing. This updated edition comes on the heels of a full year of extended community outreach, and includes several substantial changes from the 2016 text. Over the course of April and May of 2017, the Planning Commission provided comments and recommended changes, which are enumerated in the Addenda (Attachment B). Throughout the various versions of the DCP, the City Council and Boards and Commissions have provided continuous feedback to further refine the Plans core tenets and to provide detail in areas where specificity strengthened standards, policies or actions. The City Council (February 28,2012, July 9, 2013 and October 13, 2015) and Planning Commission (March 16, 2011, January 11, 2012, March 28, 2012, July 11, 2012, December 5, 2012, January 23, 2013, March 6, 2013, July 17, 2013, August 7, 2013, November 2, 2013, November 3, 2015, March 2, 2016, March 3, 2016, November 16, 2016, December 7, 2016, April 25, 2017, May 10, 2017, May 11, 2017, May 17, 2017, May 18, 2017, May 31, 2017 ) have held public hearings and provided significant input into the planning process, shaping the concepts and strategies over the last 5 years. Throughout the planning period, the planning teams communication approach has been fluid to integrate as many perspectives as possible through a variety of means. These include public workshops, focus groups, presentations to neighborhood organizations, online surveys, a dedicated interactive project website www.downtownsmplan.org and a variety of fun events such as walking tours, farmers market exhibitions and community celebrations for major milestones. Below is a list of meetings and events that have been conducted with the participation of several thousand people. "}, "title": " The Final Public Hearing Draft Downtown Community Plan and Associated Amendments to the Land use and Circulation Element, Civic Center Specific Plan, Zoning Ordinance, SMMC Chapter 9.53 and SMMC Article 8.", "Sponsors": null, "recommendations": ["     Final Public Hearing Draft Downtown Community Plan; ", "     Downtown Community Plan Final Environmental Impact Report;", "     Associated amendments to the Land Use and Circulation Element;", "     Associated amendments to the Civic Center Specific Plan;", "     Associated amendments to the Zoning Ordinance;", "   Associated amendments to SMMC Chapter 9.53 (Transportation Demand Management);", "     Associated amendments to Article 8, Section 8.08.060 (Building Regulations) ", "", ""], "Department": "Development Services (PCD)"}], [], [], [], []], "April 25 5:30 PM": [[], [], [], [{"title": null}, {"title": null}, {"title": null}, {"title": null}, {"title": null}, {"title": null}], [], [{"Department": "2: Special Agenda Items", "Category": "02.

The Citys lighting consultant, Willdan Engineering, conducted a photometric analysis based on street lighting standards established by the City of Los Angeles, Bureau of Street Lighting (BSL) and the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) of North America, to determine the height and spacing of the street light poles, and the type and wattage of the LED fixtures. The style of the street light poles was selected to match the existing street light poles on Stewart Street to the north and south of this location. The LED fixtures specified are dark-sky friendly, limit upward and visual glare, and have been specified to minimize any potential effects to human sensitivity. The increase in lighting would encourage walking, biking, and transit use especially by residents who travel during twilight hours and after dark. Further, the additional lighting is consistent with Councils Vision Zero directive laid out in the Pedestrian Action Plan adopted by Council February 23, 2016. Nighttime safety is a substantial concern among residents and multiple user surveys have named lighting as a key reason that people do not walk more. By creating well-lit pedestrian routes, especially to the new light rail stations, mobility would be enhanced. Additionally, the proposed lighting would ensure that these streets are perceived as safe pedestrian routes, encourage alternative forms of transportation, and reduce single occupant automobile trips.Contractor SelectionOn February 14, 2017, the City published a Notice Inviting Bids for the installation of CDBG funded street lighting on Stewart Street between Exposition Boulevard and Kansas Avenue in accordance with City plans and specifications. The bid was posted on the City's on-line bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provisions.

MAPS is a critical component of the Coastal Interceptor Sewer (CIS), which moves wastewater in a southerly direction along the coast from northern Los Angeles, through Santa Monica, and eventually to the Hyperion Water Reclamation Plant.  The Cities of Los Angeles and Santa Monica agreed under contract #7473 CCS to standardize wastewater charges related to using the City of Los Angeles regional Amalgamated System for transport and treatment. Under this contract, the City of Los Angeles agreed to pay 100% of MAPS maintenance with Santa Monica managing the operations, maintenance, and alteration of the system.  MAPS collects the gravity sewer flows and pumps it to Ocean Avenue, where it continues to flow by gravity through the existing CIS piping along Ocean Avenue and Neilson Way. The CIS continues through Santa Monica and Venice before eventually reaching the Hyperion Water Reclamation Plant near El Segundo. The City receives revenue from the City of Los Angeles under the Hyperion Agreement for maintenance, operation and capital improvement costs of the pump station. MAPS is the single most important sewage pump station in the City of Santa Monica and is located in very close proximity to the Santa Monica Pier, as shown in Attachment A.  Due to the critical location and function of MAPS it must be regularly monitored and maintained to minimize the risk of sewage spill or overflow. In 2013 the City retained an engineering firm to conduct a complete evaluation of MAPS. The evaluation analyzed the existing electrical, mechanical, and structural elements along with station capacity and other components of the pump station to identify future capital improvement projects to meet the future demands and to upgrade the facility accordingly.  SMURRF is a state-of-the art urban runoff recycling plant, built in 2000, located at 1623 Appian Way, which can treat up to 500,000 gallons of dry weather runoff per day, which is about 4% of the Citys daily water use. SMURRF treats dry weather runoff by conventional and advanced treatment systems to remove pollutants such as sediment, oil, grease, and pathogens from entering Santa Monica Bay. SMURRF-treated water is used for landscape irrigation and certain indoor commercial building functions. The City of Los Angeles and Santa Monica entered into a joint agreement, #7456 CCS, to recover and treat urban runoff. As part of the agreement, both parties agreed to split the costs and revenues 50/50.  On January 29, 2013, the City issued a Request for Proposals for professional engineering services to conduct the evaluation of MAPS. Lee & Ro, Inc., was recommended as the best qualified firm to conduct an evaluation of the MAPS. On August 27, 2013 (Attachment B), Council awarded a professional Services Agreement to Lee & Ro Inc. to conduct the condition evaluation of MAPS.  In March 2015, Lee & Ro, Inc. submitted the final technical report. According to the report, the replacement of the variable frequency drives (VFDs) were the high priority items and recommended for replacement. For the implementation of Lee & Ros recommendation, staff requested proposals to evaluate various VFD models and develop plans, contract documents and provide engineering support during the bidding and construction for the MAPS VFD replacement project from the same four (4) firms shortlisted for the preparation of the report. Only two (2) firms responded, (Lee & Ro Inc. and Cannon Corporation). After a comprehensive review Cannon Corporation was selected for the project.

However, prior to the current open data portals launch, the City was heavily reliant on using Portable Document Format (PDF) documents to share data with the public. This file format, which provides an electronic image of text and graphics that look like a printed document, limits the manner in which people and applications could interact with City data to conduct meaningful analysis and/or develop software applications. In May 2014, the City entered into an agreement with Socrata, Inc. to provide open data hosting capabilities. At the time of selection, Socrata was the only open data provider capable of delivering the functionality, interoperability, and user experience deemed acceptable by the City. In particular, Socrata was the only provider at the time that allowed end-users to create their own data visualizations. Moreover, Socrata had then and still maintains today a large foothold in the open data software space. Socrata customers include the Cities of New York, Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle. The Socrata platform presents data in its raw form, allowing users to conduct meaningful analysis and/or create visualizations of City data. Moreover, the Socrata open data platform comes ready with an Application Programming Interface (API) that allows computer programs to automatically place data into, and retrieve data out of, the Citys open data portal. Staff have used the API capability to automatically update data within the portal from internal City systems. External users of the site have used the Socrata API to create their own applications using City data. External (i.e. public) users of the site are able to download and/or view data from the Socrata product; only authorized staff have the ability to delete or modify data.  Usage of the open data portal has grown steadily over time- the portal has received over 1.3 million views since being launched. Traffic to the page more than doubled in 2016 as compared to prior year. Annual views count trends for data.smgov.net.  Additionally, the number of available objects on the open data portal has grown. At inception, the open data portal was preloaded with 69 objects (datasets, maps, charts, graphs, etc.). Today there are 110 objects available on the site for the public and staff to interact with. City staff have loaded in excess of 125 million rows of data into the aforementioned 110 objects. The City would like to extend the agreement with Socrata for an additional two years in order to continue open data operations as they exist today and expand the scope of services to include Socratas Open Performance product. Alternatives          The City may elect to extend the current agreement by one year. During the one-year extension, staff may gather requirements for a comprehensive open data and public-facing performance management portal. Namely, staff may have sufficient time to fold in performance management requirements as the Citys performance management framework is currently in its infancy, and firm requirements do not exist to allow for a competitive bidding process to take place.  Staff believes that a two-year extension provides sufficient flexibility for the City to develop comprehensive open data and performance management software requirements, while continuing to provide a sound open data platform to meet the current needs of City staff and the public alike. In addition to providing features and functions sought by staff and the public, Socratas standing as an industry leader creates opportunities for City staff to interact with other open data industry leaders, such as New York and Chicago, to help strengthen the Citys program.  Staff recommends that the City extend the current agreement with Socrata for an additional two years to continue open data operations as they exist today. Before the new term expires, staff will define requirements for the development of an RFP, evaluate all options available in the market for open data platforms and public-facing performance management suites and conduct a competitive bidding process for the procurement of a software solution moving forward. Vendor/Consultant SelectionIn May 2014, the City entered into an agreement with Socrata to provide robust open data hosting capabilities.

Additional design criteria have been established by various City departments who provide emergency or maintenance services. Concepts have also been aligned with federal and state guidance on roadway design, and the landscaping proposal acknowledges Californias historic drought.During the design process, each block has been individually analyzed for opportunities to accommodate the features that are desired by the community, and which support the goals of the project. The final streetscape plan incorporates a balanced mix of new features that result in a better performing, enhanced streetscape and transportation environment for vehicles, transit, pedestrians and bicycles. None of the streetscape elements being proposed results in the loss of a travel lane for vehicles. The improvements are intended to make movement for all users and modes more predictable by providing safe places for pedestrians to cross the street, identify areas for bicycles to maneuver, accommodate transit, and organize vehicle flow. The following are brief descriptions of the design features incorporated into the final design.Lincoln Boulevard Streetscape and Transportation Design Features (ATTACHMENT A):         New peak commute-hour 12-foot wide dedicated Bus Lanes         New landscaped center medians, 10 feet average width, various lengths         3 new crosswalks with pedestrian-actuated safety signals across Lincoln Boulevard located at Grant, Pine, and Wilson/Pier Streets         4 enhanced crosswalks that integrate new pedestrian refuges at Olympic, Pearl, Hill and Ashland         New crosswalk striping at 20 locations on side streets          ADA compliant dual-directional curb ramps at 90 locations along the boulevard         125 new pedestrian lights spaced at 75 foot average intervals         13 new curb-extensions and bulb-outs at strategically located side streets and in certain areas on Lincoln Blvd. north of Pico Blvd.         2 new bicycle connection improvements at Ashland and Pearl         48 new street trees in existing and/or future parkways and potentially in medians         32 bioswales for stormwater runoff         New bike racks, benches and trash receptacles         Eliminated unused curb-cuts and revised curb ramps         Wayfinding signage and markersThe primary objectives of the LiNC streetscape are to guide the transition of Lincoln Boulevard into a pedestrian-friendly environment and to improve transportation conditions for vehicles, transit and bicycles. These objectives are helpful in distilling the many components of the project into a logical implementation sequence and funding rationale. A careful review of the corridor concept was undertaken to determine which elements would: 1) provide highly visible and effective improvements to existing conditions for pedestrians, vehicles, transit and bicycles; 2) be implemented in the short-term; 3) balance cost with benefit; 4) be cost-competitive against competing projects; 5) require the least amount of disruption to traffic flow and to the local business environment, and 6) address locations where crash data identified the need for additional attention. Out of this analysis emerged two implementation phases:         Phase 1 involves a discrete set of streetscape elements that target connections. The estimated cost for Phase 1 improvements is approximately $2.9 million and could be fully implemented by the end of 2018 if appropriate approvals, funding resources and processing timelines are pursued efficiently. For a list of Phase 1 improvements, please see ATTACHMENT B.         Phase 2 includes a package of costlier upgrades and more intense construction activities that would fully complete the streetscape proposal. The estimated cost for Phase 2 improvements is estimated to exceed $10 million, and may take several years, if not more, to accumulate funding through grants and internal funding resources prior to full implementation.3 new crosswalks with pedestrian-actuated safety signals across Lincoln Boulevard located at Grant, Pine, and Wilson/Pier Streets 4 enhanced crosswalks that integrate new pedestrian refuges at Olympic, Pearl, Hill and AshlandNew landscaped center medians, 10 feet average width, various lengthsNew crosswalk striping at 20 locations on side streets 13 new curb-extensions and bulb-outs at strategically located side streets and in certain areas on Lincoln Blvd. north of Pico Blvd. 48 new street trees in existing and/or future parkways and potentially in medians32 bioswales for stormwater runoff 125 new pedestrian lights spaced at 75 foot average intervals Eliminated unused curb-cuts and revised curb rampsADA compliant dual-directional curb ramps at 90 locations along the boulevardWayfinding Signage and MarkersNew Peak Hour Directional 12-foot wide Dedicated Bus Lanes 2 new bicycle connection improvements at Ashland and Pearl New bike racks, benches and trash receptacles Peak Hour Directional 12-foot Dedicated Bus Lanes (Phase 1)Based on in-depth analysis on the applicability and benefits transportation enhancements, such as dedicated bus lanes on Lincoln Boulevard, staff recommends that the peak commute-hour dedicated bus lane lead the implementation of Phase 1. This network enhancement includes:         Peak Hour conversion of 12-foot parking lane to directional bus-only lane         Activation: Northbound 7-10AM, Southbound 4-7PM         Curbside lane configuration to accommodate existing BBB vehicles         Travel time savings of approximately 10 minutes within Santa Monica in each direction         Potential travel time savings of 25+ minutes if extended to the Green Line StationThe implementation of the dedicated bus lane does not require the same intensity of physical intervention that other Phase 1 components necessitate. Construction of the dedicated bus lane is limited to the application of a solid stripe in the roadway to define the lane, and the installation of signage prohibiting parking or vehicles to use the lane during operations. Staff has successfully secured full funding for the bus lanes implementation, which could be delivered as early as summer 2017. Outreach on the Bus Lane In early spring 2017, staff from PCD and BBB collaborated on a distinct outreach campaign to Boulevard businesses regarding the commute-hour dedicated bus lane. The purpose of this targeted one-on-one outreach was to provide businesses with the opportunity to offer additional feedback outside of the workshops, stakeholder and focus groups and online participation platforms that have been addressing Boulevard issues publically for the past two years. Working in teams, staff individually visited all of the Boulevards 128 businesses and spent time discussing the larger project, as well as the perceived impacts of the bus lane during its proposed operational hours. A dedicated GO feedback portal was opened to receive comments from the web, and staff distributed their phone numbers for follow-up. The following is the result of the outreach:         87% of businesses are either supportive, indifferent or non-responsive on the subject of the commute-hour dedicated bus lane         4% of businesses have a concern about the bus lane or the project as a whole         9% of businesses oppose the commute-hour dedicated bus laneInterdepartmental staff is working with the small percentage of businesses who have expressed a concern to identify solutions that limit potential impacts. A complete description of the outreach process and individual businesses who expressed concerns is provided in ATTACHMENT F.Three New Crosswalks (Phase 1)To promote east/west connectivity, three new crosswalks are proposed at Grant, Pine and Pier Streets, which will also aid in further unifying the relationship between neighborhoods, and reducing the divisiveness of Lincoln Boulevard. The addition of these three new crosswalks located at un-signalized intersections creates a consistent and predictable crossing pattern, approximately 600 feet (or two blocks) between crossing opportunities. Crosswalks will be accompanied by rectangular rapid flashing beacon (RRFB) signalization devices to alert drivers to the presence of a pedestrian. These proposed new crosswalks are activated by the crossing pedestrian, and do not have an impact to traffic operations.Staff analyzed ten years of crash data to finalize the locations for new crosswalks (ATTACHMENT C) between the years 2005-2015. During that time, a total of 660 crashes involving pedestrians or cyclists have been recorded on Lincoln Boulevard, including 5 fatalities. T All new crosswalks will also be enhanced with landscaped medians in order to provide pedestrian refuges for safe harbor after crossing one direction of traffic, and before taking on the next.Four Conversions of Existing to Enhanced Crosswalks (Phase 1)Data has confirmed that past upgrades to Lincoln Boulevards existing crosswalks have reduced the prevalence of conflicts at many major intersections, but further potential improvements have been identified through the LiNC process. Improvements to crossing conditions at Olympic, Pearl, Hill and Ashland are proposed in the form of new landscaped medians that are integrated into the crosswalk. Identical to the approach for the new crosswalks, these enhancements would create refuge areas for crossing pedestrians, and in some instances, such as at Hill Street, would be accompanied by additional safety and lighting devices.Landscaped Medians (Phases 1 and 2)Overall, approximately 2000 linear feet of landscaped center medians would be provided along the Boulevard in select locations to green the Boulevard and to improve the flow and organization of traffic. A modicum of landscaping that is drought tolerant and adheres to Fire and Police criteria for visibility is recommended. Trees are not viable in the medians south of Pico Boulevard due to the presence of major utilities beneath the roadway, but medians north of Pico Boulevard could accommodate some trees.Staff recommends phasing in the medians over time, focusing first on adding medians and refuges at crosswalk locations, then later filling in larger stretches of the Boulevard after a period of observation. Phase 1 implementation proposes the installation of roughly 700 linear feet of medians adjacent to new and enhanced crosswalks, which constitutes about 30% of the full median scheme outlined in the Streetscape plan. A subsequent phase of work would involve the build-out of the remaining 70% of medians, which would provide substantial traffic flow control in addition to the landscaping. Staff recommends that the City evaluate how the Phase 1 medians affect emergency access for at least a two-year period prior to wholesale implementation of corridor-wide medians.Side Street Crosswalk Striping and ADA Compatible Curb Ramps (Phases 1 and 2)To improve Boulevard access for people of all mobility levels, and to provide a visible space in the right of way for non-motorized crossings, crosswalk enhancements are proposed at every un-signalized intersection and side-street within the project area. This includes continental crosswalk striping (i.e. zebra-striped pattern) from curb to curb in 20 locations, as well as rebuilt curb ramps for ADA compliance at 90 locations (52 are included in Phase 1). Curb Extensions and Bulb-Outs (Phase 1)To promote pedestrian activity, greening of the Boulevard and neighborhood unity, Phase 1 contemplates the construction of all 13 of the curb extensions identified in the full corridor plan. The street design includes the use of curb extensions and bulb-outs at select locations within the project area to enhance connectivity, landscaping and potential stormwater capture. Opportunities to locate public art have also been identified in several of these locations. Bicycle Connection Improvements (Phase 1)Improved bicycle connections are proposed at Pearl and Ashland, which serve as crossover routes for cyclists moving along the established bikeways of 7th Street (west of Lincoln) and 11th (east of Lincoln). Pearl ConnectorSignage and markings are a recommended addition on the west side of Lincoln to provide visibility for cyclists utilizing the existing bike network of sharrows on Strand, Kensington and 7th Street to form a couplet where eastbound movements would use Kensington and additional Keep Clear markings across Lincoln would assist with crossing the Boulevard. A new bike box is proposed to be painted on the westbound approach. Ashland ConnectorSimilar to the configuration at Pearl, a couplet is proposed which would use 7th Street, Raymond and Ashland.  Sharrows are proposed on the west side of Lincoln on 7th Street northbound only and Raymond eastbound only.  Signage would be added at the intersections of 7th and Ashland, 7th and Raymond, and then Lincoln/Strand to help formalize the couplet concept.  Additional Bicycle ImprovementsThe proposed striping for a commute-hour bus lane will provide a 12-foot space adjacent to the curb. During morning/evening commute hours, this space will function as a dedicated bus facility, and prominent signage will prohibit motorists and cyclists from traveling in this space during those hours. However, when not in operation as a bus lane, this space will provide 5 feet of additional roadway space between parked cars and the number 1 travel lane for cyclists.  This will allow those who choose to ride on Lincoln more biking space, although not in a designated bicycle facility.New Street Trees (Phases 1 and 2)There is an opportunity to plant 48 new trees along the project area in sidewalk locations along the Boulevard, and in select medians north of Pico Boulevard. In accordance with the proposed Phase 1 improvements, 24 new trees are scheduled to be planted within the next year either in existing vacant tree wells, or in new parkway areas that are incorporated into the design. Staff worked extensively with the Citys Urban Forester and Urban Forest Task Force to identify four new tree species that will be used to complement the streets existing tree inventory and help achieve the Urban Forest Master Plans objectives for species diversity. Going forward, as existing trees reach the end of their natural lives, they will be replaced with the four species shown in ATTACHMENT A.Pedestrian Lighting (Phase 2)The full LiNC streetscape proposes the installation of 117 pedestrian lights and 8 pedestrian safety light poles. Standing at 13-17 feet high, these top-shielded LED lighting poles would be spaced approximately 75 feet apart to supplement the existing auto-oriented light standards. The addition of pedestrian lights to the boulevard requires an upgrade of the electrical network to allow for LED multiple-series connections. The cost of the pedestrian lights and associated electrical work exceeds $3.5 million, which presents a financial barrier at this moment in time. Staff will seek funding for the lights, which may be addressed through an upcoming Metro Call for Projects, or the Highway Safety Improvement Program.Stormwater Infiltration (Phase 2)It is the intent of the Lincoln Neighborhood Corridor plan to apply appropriate storm water best management practices (BMP) as part of the effort to comply with any applicable provisions of the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) discharge permit.  These BMPs include permeable surfaces, retention basins, and underground infiltration chambers. These would be implemented to the maximum extent practicable. Because many of the stormwater features are located beneath the roadway, it is recommended that they be installed at the same time that the full corridor landscaped medians are implemented to take advantage of efficiencies in construction. The LiNC project also includes a substantive business improvement and beautification effort, which involves short-term common-sense strategies as well as longer-term management programs that engage the local business community in supporting a more functional, aesthetically pleasing pedestrian experience. Due to the level of effort required to get many of these programs and activities off the ground, staff is not ready to bring them all forward for approval at this time, but will continue to develop them over 2017 and 2018.         Property-Based Business Improvement District: One of the long-term goals of the LiNC is to assist in the formation of a formal or informal merchant association that supports Lincoln Boulevard businesses through group representation and advocacy. As part of the LiNC process, the project team has held extensive outreach with the Lincoln Boulevard business community and boulevard property owners. The next phase of work will involve growing interest among property owners and further refining district priorities. Subsequent phases may involve hiring a Business Improvement District professional to help define district boundaries and formally establish the district through Council action.          Incentive Programs: To motivate property owners to utilize the business improvement concepts and ideas developed through the LiNC project, the project team is working on two programs for future implementation. These programs were debuted at the November 24, 2015 City Council meeting, and received direction to move forward. Lincoln Blvd. Business Improvement Fund: in coordination with the Citys Economic Development division, staff is working to create a pilot program that supports small faade-improvement projects on private property on Lincoln Boulevard with nominal matching funds, perhaps no higher than $500 per tenant space.  Conceptually, Lincoln Boulevard businesses or property owners could apply for matching funds through an application that required 1) design details as required by standard permits, 2) enrollment in the Citys Buy Local program, and 3) matching dollars or sweat equity equal to or greater than the Citys maximum contribution. The results of the pilot program could be used as a case study to help encourage and inspire other property owners and businesses to undertake improvements with small budgets.          Fee Suspension for Staff Level Architectural Review Board (ARB) Applications: many code violations or complaints about the Boulevards aesthetic stem from outdated or non-conforming building features, such as signage, paint and exterior treatments, and landscaping.  Many of these items require staff-level ARB approval, which carries a $350 fee that is an impediment to many Lincoln Boulevard businesses.  In coordination with the Planning Department, staff could draft a Council resolution that, if adopted, could suspend ARB fees for staff-level approvals for a limited time, perhaps up to one year. During that period, staff would actively work with local businesses, code enforcement and other entities to address improvements on a case-by-case basis, gradually enhancing the corridor. Handbooks: A great deal of work has been performed to create a vision for Lincoln Boulevard that cohesively blends streetscape improvements with private-property upgrades and investment in new uses. To support private property owners and businesses in participating in this large scale transformation, staff is developing a series of handbooks that provide illustrative guidance for:          Adaptive Reuse: reuse of existing low-scale buildings to accommodate new or expanded uses without substantially altering the building envelope.         Change of Use: new pedestrian oriented uses that occupy former auto-oriented spaces.         New Construction: new infill projects that are compatible with the surrounding fabric and texture of Lincoln Boulevard.The handbooks are envisioned to provide concise information about best practices for creating a better pedestrian experience at human scale. This work will employ a graphic designer and a team of City staff to reduce bureaucratic language and process explanations into a user-friendly guide that will be provided to all businesses and property owners on the corridor.Environmental AnalysisThe LINC project is categorically exempt from CEQA pursuant to Sections 15301, 15303, and 15304 of the CEQA Guidelines.          The project consists of alterations to existing Lincoln Boulevard and no expansion of roadway capacity is proposed.  Therefore, the project falls into the Class 1 exemption. Section 15301 of CEQA Guidelines provides (Class 1) exemption for the operation, repair, maintenance, permitting, or minor alteration of existing public or private structures, facilities, mechanical equipment or topographical features, involving negligible or no expansion of use beyond that existing at the time of the lead agency's determination.  Projects that fall into this class of exemption include alterations to existing streets, sidewalks, gutter, bicycle facilities, and other similar facilities and additions of safety or health protection during for use in conjunction with existing facilities.            The proposed LINC would construct new small facilities and structures including landscaped medians, curb extensions, curb ramps, crosswalk striping, pavement striping, pedestrian lighting, bike racks, benches, and wayfinding markings on existing Lincoln Boulevard. Section 15303 of CEQA Guidelines provides (Class 3) exemption for the construction and location of limited numbers of new small facilities or structures.   Projects that fall into this class of exemption include street improvements of reasonable length. Therefore, the project falls into the Class 3 exemption.          The proposed LINC project would install new paving, pavement/crosswalk markings, and refreshed landscaping that would include new street trees, mulch, ground cover, or low water use plantings on Lincoln Boulevard. Section 15304 of CEQA Guidelines provides (Class 4) exemption for minor public or private alterations in the condition of land, water, and or vegetation which do not involve removal of healthy, mature, scenic trees.   Therefore, the project falls into the Class 4 exemption.In addition, none of the exceptions specified in Section 15300.2 of CEQA Guidelines would preclude the use of these CEQA exemptions - The project site is not located in a sensitive environment, the project will not have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances, the project would not damage scenic resources, the project would not be located on a hazardous waste site; and the project would not cause a change to a historical resource.  Therefore, this project is categorically exempt per Sections 15301, 15303, and 15304 of the CEQA Guidelines.Once Council approves the project, the design team will finalize the Streetscape Design and begin implementation of the project in accordance with the following timeline: Spring/Summer 2017  Dedicated Bus Lanes         Work on the Dedicated Bus Lane began in February of this year with formal outreach to the local business community. Pending reaffirmation of the bus lane and parking restrictions by City Council, staff believes a dedicated bus lane facility could be installed as early as summer 2017. Funding for this project has been made available through the CIP process.April 2017- January 2018  Construction Documents for Phase 1 Implementation         Funding has been identified through the CIP process to fund construction documentation for Phase 1 implementation. This CIP funding will be presented to Council for approval as part of the FY 2017-18 Capital Improvement Program budget, and will be used to finance the creation of bidding documents that can be used to select a preferred contractor to build Phase 1 at a later date.January 2018-May 2019  Construction of Phase 1 Implementation         Funding has been identified for the cost of constructing Phase 1, which will roll out over a period of approximately 12 months, though the community will begin to see improvements much sooner than the May 2019 completion date. Public Works staff is assessing the possibility of an implementation sequence to address crosswalks in the short-term, with more construction heavy activities to follow.", "background": "The project area is located within three neighborhoods along 17 blocks of Lincoln Boulevard from the I-10 Freeway (including the bridge overpass) to Ozone Avenue, approximately 1.25 miles long. The project boundaries include the vehicular right-of-way, as well as the public sidewalk and the ground floor of the buildings that front Lincoln Blvd. Caltrans relinquished Lincoln Boulevard to the City of Santa Monica in 2012, which stimulated public and private interests in addressing deferred maintenance issues and in fulfilling the vision of the LUCE for a more walkable and aesthetically pleasing corridor. In 2013, the Public Works Department and Traffic Engineering Division conducted a street resurfacing and striping project that improved vehicular operations and laid the groundwork for future transit efficiency by modifying right-of-way striping to accommodate potential dedicated bus lanes. The resurfacing project improved the visual condition of Lincoln Boulevard, but left more substantive streetscape modifications (such as medians or crosswalks), policy recommendations and other enhancements to be resolved by the Lincoln Neighborhood Corridor Plan.On June 10, 2014 (ATTACHEMNT G) the City Council authorized the City Manager to negotiate and execute a contract (CCS #9651) with Community Design and Architecture (CD+A) to prepare a detailed streetscape and transportation concept for Lincoln Boulevard between the I-10 Freeway and the City limits at Ozone Avenue. The Council later authorized an amendment to this contract on July 28, 2016 to provide additional design development to address emergency access concerns from the Fire Department. Streetscape Plan DevelopmentBeginning in August 2014, an interdepartmental team led by Planning and Community Development began work on the LiNC to develop streetscape, transportation and business improvement concepts. Leveraging relationships with neighborhood leaders and members of the Lincoln Boulevard Taskforce, the planning team conducted extensive outreach to address key concerns and develop consensus on a preferred streetscape alternative. Outreach activities included two community workshops, dozens of one-on-one and group stakeholder meetings, focus groups with local businesses, and an online presence that included social media and civic engagement platforms.Since August 2014, staff has presented LiNC concepts to the Planning Commission, City Council and other boards and commissions to further refine streetscape and transportation enhancements. Feedback was used to direct resources to specific issues that warranted additional research and investigation. Staff met with the Planning Commission on three occasions: 1) on October 1, 2014 (ATTACHMENT H) to introduce the project and obtain directional guidance, 2) on September 2, 2015 (ATTACHMENT I) to solicit input about emerging plan elements and obtain direction on key policy questions that had surfaced during concept development, and 3) on February 15, 2017 (ATTACHMENT J) to finalize the streetscape concept and take action on a unanimous recommendation for approval. Staff presented the LiNC project to the City Council on one occasion on November 24, 2015 (ATTACHEMNT K). At subsequent public meetings before the Recreation and Parks Commission, Architectural Review Board and in community workshops, staff received additional guidance, and interdepartmental team members helped the project team refine design criteria and implementation options that informed the final concepts presented in this staff report.  Public Participation and Community OutreachIn collaboration with multi-departmental staff, the project team has worked with a wide range of constituents to develop streetscape, transportation and business improvement concepts. Neighborhood leaders communicate frequently with staff through the Lincoln Boulevard Taskforce, which includes representation from the Ocean Park, Sunset Park and Pico neighborhoods, as well as from the Santa Monica Malibu Unified School District. The outreach effort has involved many different forms of outreach in which participants have explored the range of issues, concerns and ideas surrounding the Boulevard, and have worked with staff to develop a preferred alternative. Outreach has involved two well-attended community workshops, stakeholder interviews and focus groups, regular meetings with the resident-led Lincoln Boulevard Taskforce, and technology and social media platforms. A separate effort to work with Boulevard businesses on any perceived impacts from the proposed commute-hour dedicated bus lane has also been conducted and is described in more detail later in this report.", "summary": "Since successfully taking over responsibility for Lincoln Boulevard from Caltrans in 2012, the City of Santa Monica has worked with local residents and businesses to improve one of our communitys most important but neglected transportation and business corridors.The Lincoln Neighborhood Corridor Plan (the LiNC) consists of two main components: enhancing the physical environment and pedestrian safety through streetscape improvements and supporting the aesthetic transformation of the corridor by incentivizing the remodel of existing businesses. The project has reached a milestone with the completion of the final design concept for the streetscape and transportation proposal. This report provides information on the streetscape design effort, and summarizes the various design components and programmatic changes that will be implemented over time. Council is being asked to approve the LiNC streetscape design and transportation concept now prior to the completion of the projects business improvement measures, which are being developed on a separate timeline. The proposed streetscape and transportation enhancements would fulfill the Land Use and Circulation Elements (LUCE) policy direction to transition the busy commuting corridor of Lincoln Boulevard into a pedestrian-oriented environment. Work on the streetscape and transportation concept has spanned several years, and has identified opportunities for new crosswalks, landscaped medians and pedestrian refuges, pedestrian lighting, bicycle connectors and many other elements. Importantly, the LiNC has integrated a peak commute-hour dedicated bus lane into the right-of-way (with no net impact to vehicle flow) as a means to support Lincolns role as a transit priority corridor and to increase transit ridership.Recent work on the streetscape and transportation concept has involved identifying a realistic phasing program for implementation that takes into account a variety of factors such as construction costs, available funding sources, pedestrian and bicycle crash data, emergency vehicle access and alignment of project purpose with the Citys strategic initiatives. Two phases of work have been identified.At its February 15, 2017 meeting, the Planning Commission unanimously recommended approval of the LiNC streetscape and transportation plan. "}, "title": " Design approval for the Lincoln Neighborhood Corridor Plan Streetscape", "Sponsors": null, "recommendations": [], "Department": "Strategic Planning (PCD)"}, {"Category": "08. Administrative Item", "body": {"other": "While park maintenance and operations funding is an important consideration, the most significant shortfall is in capital funding to acquire, design and construct additional parks and park facilities. With the 2012 elimination of the Santa Monica Redevelopment Agency, the City lost a major source of funding for capital improvement projects. The remaining sources of funding as described in the Background section above are insufficient to fund major park expansion or renovation projects. A preliminary list of projects that could be supported through a local capital funding measure include:   The 12-acre expansion of Airport Park which currently has funding for design only;  A permanent sports field in the Civic Center with subterranean parking to offset the loss of existing surface parking;   Implementation of a full renovation of Memorial Park;   Planning for the transformation of the Airport to park land following its closure;Identification of potential joint use opportunities with School District as well as land acquisition and park development opportunities for future park expansion in underserved neighborhoods A general obligation (GO) bond, which would require approval by two thirds of the voters, would provide the most capital funding at once for parks in Santa Monica. Other methods to create a local funding source, which would still require a financing mechanism such as a lease revenue bond to generate funding up front, would require voter-approved increases to City tax rates to pay for the annual debt service. Additional consideration would need to be given to funding streams for operating costs into the future. Community support for a GO Bond or other funding mechanism can be gauged through polling. The recommended poll would survey 600 Santa Monica voters. The poll could gauge voter preferences regarding the use of the new City proceeds for parks. For example, a poll could test whether voters find that new parks and open space or improvements to existing parks, cultural services or some other use to be most compelling. The proposed budget includes sufficient funding to poll twice should it be necessary. Recreation and Parks Commission The Recreation and Parks Commission will discuss the concept of a park funding measure at their meeting on April 20, 2017. Staff will provide the Council with an oral report summarizing the Commissions discussion and any action at the Council meeting. Vendor/Consultant SelectionIn 2014, the City issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) seeking a public opinion and research consulting firm to conduct the citywide telephone survey. Following review of proposals by an interdepartmental evaluation committee, on June 28, 2015, Council authorized the City Manager to negotiate and execute an agreement with Goodwin Simon Strategic Research to prepare citywide Resident Satisfaction Surveys. There have been three amendments to this contract to date for two polls regarding affordable housing prior to placing measures GSH and GS on the November 2016 ballot and a survey of travel behaviors in 2016 to gain a better understanding of travel patterns of Santa Monica residents. Given the firms familiarity with Santa Monica and experience in polling Santa Monica residents for various measures, staff recommends a fourth amendment to the existing contract with Goodwin Simon Strategic Research. On March 16, 2017 the City issued Request for Proposals (RFP) #31717 for Strategic Advisory Services for this potential bond measure with the intent that the selected consultant would work in collaboration with City staff and Goodwin Simon Strategic Research to provide advice, recommendations and support in the following areas.          Expected voter acceptance or antipathy towards prospective GO bond measure;         Input towards draft survey instrument;         Review of survey results;         Advise on likelihood of passage of potential GO Bond measure;         Development of communication strategies to support voter consideration; including strategies to engage key stakeholders; The RFP was posted on the Citys on line bidding site and closed on March 30, 2017.  Sixty vendors downloaded the RFP and four firms responded. Responses to the RFP were reviewed by a selection panel of staff from the Community & Cultural Services and Finance departments. Following interviews on April 11 and April 12, 2017, it was determined that TBWB Strategies is the most qualified firm and best bidder based on overall approach and work plan, the teams qualifications, and experience with similar proposed ballot measures. Staff intends to proceed with entering into a contract with TBWB Strategies in the amount of $78,000 which is within the City Managers contract authority.   Next StepsWith Council approval, initial polling of residents regarding support for a park bond measure would be anticipated to occur later this spring. Staff would then return to Council with results of the polling and recommended next steps, with the understanding that Council action would be needed by summer 2018 to place a measure on the November 2018 ballot. Concurrently staff is proceeding with a number of parks related activities as follows:          Development of final plans and the EIR for the 12-acre Airport Park expansion anticipating that the Council would consider certification of the Final EIR this fall;          Completion of the Civic Field feasibility study and progress on a potential partnership with SMMUSD for a permanent field with subterranean parking returning to Council in June;         Launch of the Memorial Park masterplan in FY17-18 using funds identified in the FY17-19 Capital Improvement Program budget          Initiate update to the Parks and Recreation Master Plan in FY17-18.   ", "background": "Santa Monica has a long history of investing in its parks, beach and recreational facilities as supported by both the Parks and Recreation Master Plan (Attachment A) and the Citys Open Space Element (Attachment B). Santa Monicas first Parks and Recreation Master Plan, completed in 1997, was intended to guide improvements of the Citys parks and recreational facilities for twenty years. The plan recognized that these improvements would add to the livability of the City and would build a sense of community by creating opportunities for physical, social and cultural interaction. Since 1997, the City has increased its park acreage from 112.7 acres to 137 acres, providing a range of places and amenities for community members to exercise, experience nature, socialize with others, participate in cultural events and enjoy the outdoors, helping people thrive, stay healthy and build community. In addition to increasing park acreage, existing park and beach facilities have been improved over the past two decades resulting in upgraded amenities and new features that address emerging trends.  Historically, funding for these improvements has come from a variety of sources including the Citys General Fund; City Enterprise funds (i.e. Beach Fund); Santa Monica Redevelopment Agency funds; grants from County, State and Federal government sources; private donations and a range of development fees assessed through the Municipal Code and as part of negotiated Development Agreements .  These funding sources alone will not be sufficient to fulfill the future park needs of Santa Monica reducing the Citys ability to close the gap between the current park acreage as it relates to the Citys population (1.4 acres for every1000 residents) and the countywide average of parkland (3.3 acres for every1000 residents).  In November, 2016 Los Angeles County voters supported the passage of the Safe, Clean, Neighborhood Parks and Beaches ballot measure (Measure A) by more than the 2/3 super majority required. As a parcel tax, it will provide direct funding to Santa Monica on a per capita basis for parks improvements beginning in July, 2018. It is estimated by the County that Santa Monica will receive approximately $10 million over a 10-year period as well as be eligible for competitive grant funds. This funding, while beneficial, will not be sufficient for the projects Santa Monica envisions. In November 2016, Santa Monica voters also approved Santa Monica College Measure V supporting capital improvements at SMC as well as several joint use projects in Santa Monica and Malibu including up to $20 million in bond funds for the expansion of Memorial Park to accommodate soccer and/or other field sports for use by College students and the general public. It is contemplated that these funds would need to be supplemented by additional funding to achieve a full upgrade and transformation of Memorial Park inclusive of redesign of the recreation buildings to better meet community needs.  At the State level two similar park funding bills are being considered for the June 2018 ballot. AB18 the California Clean Water, Climate and Coastal Protection and Outdoor Access for All Act of 2018 would authorize the issuance of $3 billion in General Obligation bonds for a variety of open space improvements throughout the state including local park improvements. Similarly, SB5, the California Drought, Water, Parks, Climate, Coastal Protection and Outdoor Access For All Act of 2018 would also authorize the issuance of $3 billion in General Obligation bonds for open space improvements. At this time there is no certainty that either of these bills will be signed by the Governor and advance to the June 2018 ballot. With assistance from the Citys lobbyist staff will continue to monitor these potential measures. ", "summary": "In August 2015, Council identified Learn + Thrive as one of its top Strategic Goals. The City of Santa Monica Wellbeing Index also identified that spending time outdoors, whether exercising or relaxing brings both emotional and physical benefits. Santa Monicas parks provide clear opportunities for community members to thrive by providing places for residents to recreate, meet friends and be active. For many of our residents who live in multi-family housing, the Citys parks and the beach are their front and back yards. Based upon the 2016 Los Angeles Countywide Parks Needs Assessment, Santa Monica has 1.4 acres of parkland/1000 residents which is well below the countywide average of 3.3 acres for every1000 residents. While expanding park acreage in Santa Monica is desired, future funding for parks expansion and for upgrades to existing parks will be very limited due to budget realities, hampering the ability to implement a number of the projects that Council has already funded for design. Therefore, it is timely to explore a possible local funding measure for the November 2018 ballot. In order to assess voter opinions regarding a local parks funding measure, staff recommends a contract modification in the amount of $51,350 for the Citys contracted survey research firm, Goodwin Simon Strategic Research to complete up to two telephone surveys to assess resident support. Additionally, staff has selected TBWB Strategies to provide strategic advisory services for a potential bond measure at a cost of $78,000 which is within the City Managers budget authority. "}, "title": " Planning for Potential Parks Funding", "Sponsors": null, "recommendations": ["eview and comment on the concept of a potential park funding measure, provide direction to staff, and authorize the City Manager to negotiate and execute a fourth modification to agreement #10141 in the amount of $51,350 with Goodwin Simon Strategic Research, a California-based company, to conduct a resident survey to gauge support for a potential park funding strategy.

Administrative Item", "body": {"other": "The City purchased Mountain View Mobile Home Park (Park) in December 2000. Prior to City ownership, the Park was privately owned by the Ring Trading Corporation (Ring). In the 1990s, tenants of the Park and Ring independently filed lawsuits against the City for alleged damages caused by an adjacent City-owned abandoned landfill. The residents' lawsuits against the City were dismissed by the court in December 1998. The Ring lawsuit against the City was resolved through a Settlement Agreement, which included the Citys acquisition of the Park in December 2000. In addition to settling the lawsuits, the Citys acquisition created opportunities to preserve affordable housing and develop a plan for needed infrastructure improvements at the Park. The City purchased the Park using Redevelopment and Tenant Ownership Rights Charter Amendment funds targeted for affordable housing. As part of the purchase, the Park was deed-restricted for future occupancy by low- and moderate-income households.  On December 11, 2012 (Attachment A), Council directed staff to explore disposition of all City-owned affordable housing properties, including the Park. Council provided the direction in order to focus on the Citys core affordable housing competencies of administering rental-assistance programs and creating affordable housing opportunities. Council recognized that affordable housing organizations, rather than the City, possess core competencies in owning and operating affordable housing. Since the Council direction, all City-owned affordable housing has been transitioned, except for the Park.  Request for Proposals ProcessAt its April 12, 2016 meeting (Attachment B), Council authorized staff to issue an RFP to affordable housing organizations to acquire and operate the Park as affordable housing. On May 26, 2016, staff met with Park residents to discuss the RFP process and solicit feedback regarding desirable qualities of new management, ideas for new amenities, and preferences regarding RFP review and comment opportunities. On June 9, 2016, a draft RFP was provided to Park residents, incorporating input from the May meeting with Park residents and providing Park residents with a two-week comment period, pursuant to their request. On July 21, 2016 (Attachment C), staff presented the draft RFP, along with input from Park residents, to the Housing Commission (Commission) for additional public comment. On September 7, 2016, staff returned to residents to present a revised draft RFP for final comments. On September 28, 2016, staff issued the RFP. The RFP opportunity was marketed directly to mobile-home park owners and operators through industry publications and trade-association distribution lists, reaching more than 600 members. Additionally, the RFP was emailed directly to organizations using a staff log of interested parties and general affordable housing organizations. The notice of RFP was also posted in the Santa Monica Daily Press, on PlanetBids, on City posting sites, and on a City webpage which was created specifically for the RFP issuance process. Interested parties were invited to scheduled tours of the Park, and to submit questions during an RFP question and answer period. Nine organizations toured the Park and eleven organizations submitted a total of 133 questions. On November 10, 2016, staff posted responses to the questions and provided 13 supporting reference documents on the project webpage. Staff received proposals from three organizations by the December 1, 2016, submission deadline. Given the unique (only mobile-home park owned by the City), and complex (rent-controlled, deed-restricted, mix of homeowners and renters) nature of the Park, staff engaged Keyser Marston Associates, Inc. (KMA), a financial/real estate/economics consultant with deep experience in affordable housing, to assess the financial feasibility of the proposals and the capacity of proposing organizations. KMAs assessment concluded that all three proposals met financial feasibility and capacity thresholds.  Each submitted proposal is approximately 150 pages. In order to familiarize Park residents with each proposing organization and associated proposal, staff facilitated three independent meetings where each organization presented its proposed approach to owning and operating the Park, and residents were provided a forum to ask questions regarding the proposal presentations and provide oral comments. Residents were also provided an opportunity to submit written comments regarding each organization and associated proposal.  A five-member evaluation committee (Committee) was formed with staff from the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles (nonprofit legal-services organization), Santa Monica Planning Division (land-use and zoning regulations), Santa Monica Rent Control Agency (rent-control regulations), and Community Corporation of Santa Monica and Hollywood Community Housing Corporation (nonprofit affordable-housing organizations).  Committee members were asked to:1.     Independently review and preliminarily score each proposal based on the RFP evaluation criteria; and  2. Meet, confer, and provide collective final scores for each proposal and a recommendation based on the RFP evaluation criteria. The Committee recommended that the City select Caritas as the owner and operator.  On March 30, 2017 (Attachment D), staff presented a recommendation to the Housing Commission (Commission) to negotiate with Caritas for transfer of the Park. The Commission supported the recommendation for Caritas, while noting that specific income-targeting and appropriate funding expenditures should be identified before a transfer is finalized. The proposal package, including supporting reference documents and submitted proposals, were included in the March 30, 2017 staff report to the Commission.  On-going Property ManagementRECS has been providing property management services at the Park since 2010 pursuant to a Council-authorized contract (see Attachments E, F, G, H, I, and J). RECS has performed well, demonstrating expertise in property-management services, familiarity with City rental regulations, and professionalism in their communications with residents. The current RECS contract expires in June 2017, and would need to be extended through June 2018 while business terms and conditions are negotiated with the selected proposer and Council considers final approval. Proposal to Acquire and Operate the ParkEach proposing organization demonstrated experience with owning affordable mobile- home parks. Caritas emerged as the preferred owner and operator with significant experience and financial capacity, a solid framework for property management, and a collaborative approach to managing a mobile-home park property with both homeowners and renters. Key factors that distinguished Caritas from other proposing organizations include:1.     Experiencea. Caritas owns and operates 20 mobile home parks with a total of 3,665 spaces. Comparatively, one of the proposers owns six parks totaling 925 spaces, and the other proposer owns nine parks totaling 915 spaces. b. Caritas has a continuous, 20-year history as a mobile-home park owner and operator. Comparatively, the other proposers have 19 and 15 years of experience. c. Caritas has purchased six mobile-home parks from the cities of Garden Grove and Lancaster, and entered into regulatory agreements with the cities of Brea, Palmdale, Rohnert Park, San Marcos, Vista, and Yucaipa.  d. In 2014, Caritas successfully refinanced six existing mobile home properties and acquired three new mobile-home properties with $85 million in bond financing.2. Financial CapacityStandard & Poors Rating Services determined Caritas long-term rating to be stable, and in reviewing a previous Caritas credit profile, provided the following findings:a. Caritas properties have very strong economic fundamentals and market dependencies, reflecting excellent demand due to relative affordability and desirable locations.b. Caritas demonstrates strong property ownership and management by an experienced owner and property manager with extensive track records in the operation and management of mobile home parks. c. Caritas financial strength is indicated by strong loss-coverage levels and strong projected debt-service on bonds. 3. Management Plana. Caritas affirmatively accepts existing restrictions (Rules & Regulations Regulatory Agreement, Rent Control Law), and agrees to enter into a new regulatory agreement to maintain ongoing affordability.  b. All three proposers agreed to take ownership of the 29 rental homes currently owned by the City, although one of the three proposers (not Caritas) expressed some reservations due to concerns regarding conflicts when a mobile-home park owner also owns some of the mobile homes.  c. Caritas proposes a plan for placing manufactured homes on the currently vacant 13 spaces, and proposes a strategy for resolving the issues associated with the 11 spaces which are compromised by encroachment from adjacent mobile homes (pursuant to Council action on April 12, 2016) by approaching existing homeowners with new home opportunities. Comparatively, the other proposers have not affirmatively committed to placing homes on all vacant and encroached spaces.  d. Caritas offers a program designed to educate and encourage mobile home renters to become home owners. e. Caritas has a comprehensive management agreement with Birtcher Anderson, a management company with over 40 years of experience, to manage all mobile home parks owned by Caritas. The structure provides a strong continuing relationship between the park owner and the management company, and economies of scale for management framework and resources. 4. Community EngagementCaritas provided more specific information about its outreach to multi-cultural and multi-lingual communities, compared to the other two proposers. Examples of programs include after-school games and activities, summer reading programs, English as a Second Language classes, exercise classes, and movie and game nights. Caritas community programs encourage and empower residents to take an active role in collaborating with management to develop social and educational programs that serve the needs of residents. Park Resident FeedbackPark residents who attended the proposal presentations and submitted written comments expressed favorable comments related to all three proposals. Park resident attendance ranged from 14 to 18 residents per presentation, and seven to eight written comments were submitted by residents regarding each proposal. Caritas received positive comments for its responsiveness to the RFP, approach to management, community involvement, and experience with owning and operating 20 mobile-home parks. The other two proposals received positive comments for responsiveness to the RFP and for providing handouts at the presentation. Some residents expressed concerns related to management diversity, out-sourced property management, and possible rent increases associated with the presentations of the other two proposers.  At the March 30, 2017 Commission meeting, three out of four Park residents in attendance affirmatively expressed support for the recommendation to select Caritas and proceed with negotiations. One Park resident in attendance spoke favorably of RECS and staffs dedication to the Park, but did not address the staff recommendation regarding the transfer of Park ownership. Financial FeasibilityAll three proposers identified the existing Park structure as financially infeasible due to a combination of challenges: low rents, minimal allowable annual rent increases, significant vacancies (several due to lot encroachments), and the high cost of property management due to the 29 City-owned rental homes. As a result, each proposal contemplates various forms of financial assistance from the City to ensure long-term financial viability. The primary variables that impact the financial assistance associated with long-term viability include: 1.     Minimal rent increases subject to the Rent Control Board annual general adjustment.Vacancy de-control is not applicable to mobile home parks, therefore rents cannot be increased to market rate after a vacancy. Maximum annual rent increases at the Park are limited to the Rent Control Board annual general adjustment, which has averaged one percent per year over the past five years. The financial viability of the Park will be stressed if operating expenses outpace rental revenue increases. 2. Property tax burden once the Park transitions to private ownership.Under City ownership, the Park is exempt from property taxes. Upon transfer, the Park owner would receive property tax abatement only for spaces occupied by tenants certified as low-income households. Obtaining appropriate household income documentation will be crucial to achieving the necessary tax exemption and maintaining the financial viability of the Park. 3. Placing new homes on vacant spaces to stabilize Park revenue, including resolving use of vacant spaces containing existing encroachments.The net annual loss for the Park between fiscal years 2013-14 and 2015-16 averaged $92,000. The Park is currently generating revenue from 81 out of the available 105 spaces due to vacancies. Of the 24 vacant spaces, 13 spaces are available for immediate use. The maximum allowable space rent in the Park is currently $378 per month. Leasing the 13 spaces, projected within two years of transfer, would generate approximately $59,000 in additional annual revenue, leaving a continued operating gap. Resolving the issues associated with the 11 spaces compromised by encroachment from adjacent mobile homes would further enhance operating revenue, strengthening the financial viability of the Park. 4. Citys commitment to fund reserve accounts.The Park is currently not generating sufficient revenue to cover operating expenses and may need a one-time capitalized operating reserve at transition to fortify the Parks financial capacity until vacant and encumbered spaces are occupied with new homes over time. 5. Capital improvementsPark residents have expressed an interest in improvements to the community building for gatherings and community-building activities. Funding for upgrades to the community building would also enhance the marketability of vacant spaces. In 2009, the City completed a $5 million infrastructure project to underground electrical, telephone, and cable television lines; improve natural gas, potable water, sanitary sewer, and street-lighting systems; and upgrade curb, gutter, and roadway pavement surfaces. The City recently completed an expansion of the pool deck, replacement of the pool fence, and installation of a pool lift for persons living with disabilities. 6. Restricted household income level of future households.All three proposals model Park occupancy assuming home ownership on the existing vacant spaces. Whether the new tenants can afford to purchase and install new manufactured homes depends on the desired target population for the vacant spaces. New manufactured homes are estimated to range in cost from $55,000 to $75,000. A household with incomes at the lowest end of the spectrum would need a 100 percent subsidy to purchase a new manufactured home, while a very low-income household would need the majority of the cost subsidized. A low- or moderate-income household would likely not need a subsidy to purchase a new manufactured home. 7. Citys commitment to fund a homeowner program for existing renters of City-owned manufactured homes. None of the proposals project long-term viability without programs to help renters become owners.As owner of the 29 rental homes, the City is currently responsible for expenses related to regular maintenance and repairs of the homes. Furthermore, the financial burden of upkeep compounds as the homes age and would continue to strain the Parks financial viability. These factors result in atypical operating expenses for the Park when compared with tradition mobile-home parks occupied entirely by homeowners, who are responsible for the maintenance and repairs of their homes.  Negotiating ParametersThe Park must maintain long-term financial viability, provide quality property management and resident engagement, sustain affordable rents pursuant to housing covenants and the Rent Control Law, and minimize the investment of limited housing funds. As a result, staff recommends that the Council adopt parameters to guide the negotiations with a selected proposer. Recommended parameters for the disposition agreements include:1.     Develop a long-term financial operating plan that reflects the housing-affordability covenants and rent-control restrictions associated with the property and ensure sufficient annual budgets to support quality property management and resident services, while minimizing housing-trust-fund assistance that is necessary to support long-term viability; 2. For City financial assistance that is required, direct resources toward capital replacement and operating funds at transition, rather than on-going assistance; 3. Include a detailed strategy to encourage mobile-home renters to become owners, including financial impacts associated with the strategy; 4. Include a plan with financial contingencies for renters who choose not to become owners; 5. Include a cost-effective plan to finance common-area improvements (e.g., clubhouse, lighting, fencing) over the short-term and long-term, including incorporation of the Citys sustainability initiatives; 6. Include a plan for occupancy of vacant spaces that respects the Citys policy for addressing vacancies (i.e. existing residents may maintain encroachments until they leave voluntarily or otherwise give up the encroachment voluntarily) while incorporating the Citys sustainability initiatives; 7. Include a plan for new occupancy of vacant spaces to incorporate a mix of affordability levels;  8. Include a provision to ensure that the Citys long-term interests are maintained, such as a City option to repurchase the property at the end of the affordability covenant term. 9. Include a plan for addressing property-tax expenses, including obtaining income-qualification information from existing residents, as well as funding property taxes in cases where income qualifications cannot be met. On-going Property ManagementThe scope of property management duties that RECS currently performs covers all necessary routine functions, including: handling day-to-day operations; supervision and coordination of maintenance and repair contracts; payment of all operating expenses such as utilities, maintenance, repairs and fees; occupancy responsibilities, including leasing and rent collection. Citys Housing staff provides direct oversight of RECS to ensure effective and efficient management, including conferring with RECS weekly and reviewing monthly status reports. In December 2016, staff recommended a six-month extension of the RECS contract in anticipation of transferring the Park by June 2017. The proposals received in response to the RFP, and recommendation from the Committee and Commission, show that transferring the Park in a manner that meets the Citys expectations would require significant negotiations, development of detailed long-term plans, and final Council approval. Therefore, staff recommends extending the existing property management contract with RECS for an additional twelve months through June 2018, to ensure continued management until proposed deal terms can be approved by Council and the transfer completed. The current contract expires on June 30, 2017. Council could select a transferee and authorize the City Manager to negotiate and execute final transfer documents pursuant to Council-adopted parameters.  However, the opportunity for public review and Council approval of specific terms such as affordability levels and total city investment would be missed. Council could also reject all proposals and direct staff to conduct a new RFP process, which staff does not believe would result in different outcomes. Finally, Council could reject all proposals and maintain City ownership of the Park. Such an approach would distract the City from its core affordable-housing competencies of operating rental-assistance programs and supporting the production and preservation of affordable housing.  With Council direction, staff would proceed to negotiate with Caritas pursuant to the parameters described in this report, and return to Council with deal terms for Council consideration.  ", "summary": "Council directed staff to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to affordable housing organizations to acquire and operate Mountain View Mobile Home Park (Park) as long-term, affordable housing.

Staff also created a forum for Park residents to meet the three organizations, hear presentations, ask questions, and provide feedback. A five-member evaluation committee (Committee) of non-profit and government professionals was formed to evaluate the proposals, consider Park residents comments, review the consultants assessment, and rate the proposals.

Consent Calendar", "body": {"other": "The WSRP is a roadmap developed in response to impending and ongoing water supply shortages. It is updated at least every five years as part of the State required Urban Water Management Plan. There are five stages (Advisory and Stage 1 to 4) of water supply shortages within the WSRP and actions range from voluntary to mandatory water conservation. The mandatory conservation requirements are implemented through Allowances assigned to water customers. Water customers are required to reduce their usage by a set percentage depending on the current stage of water supply shortage. Stage 1Stage 2Stage 3Stage 4% Water Available per Customer 85% 80% 70% 50%    In response to the unprecedented drought and its ongoing effects on Santa Monicas water supply, the City remains in a Stage 2 Water Supply Shortage that requires a 20% reduction in water use from 2013 levels. Local groundwater provides about 75% of the Citys water supply, which has yet to recover fully, even with the recent record-breaking rains. The natural process by which this occurs takes time and it may be a few years, along with more wet winters, for local groundwater supplies to return to pre-drought conditions.In order to be at least as effective as the current California Green Building Standards, the WSRP must be updated to reflect new requirements for plumbing fixture flow rates. This includes lower flows for urinals and faucets. As part of the recently adopted water neutrality ordinance, developers are required to calculate the projected water demand for a new development project. For the purpose of the water neutrality ordinance, new developments are defined as: new buildings with plumbing fixtures; existing buildings with plumbing fixtures where 50% or more of the exterior walls or major support structures are demolished; and/or new or enlarged pools, spas, water features, and ponds. If the calculated water demand from the proposed new development is greater than the amount the property currently uses (using a five-year average), then the developer must attempt to design a more water-efficient property through fixtures and systems (e.g. graywater and rain water harvesting). If the new development is still projected to use more water after all practical water-saving devices and systems are included in the design, then an in-lieu fee is required. Those fees pay to retrofit existing off-site buildings with water-saving fixtures to offset the additional water demand of the new development. Once approved, the calculated water demand for the new development would be used as the Allowance for the property during a declared water supply shortage providing a realistic yet water-conserving target. Currently, Allowances are a 20% reduction from usage in 2013. New developments that calculate greater water use than the current propertys five-year average would not likely meet Allowances as defined and, subsequently, could be fined for exceedances. This would trigger requests for adjustments to their Allowances. These adjustment requests would be granted because the developments would be built to the current water-efficient building requirements, which is a pre-requisite for an adjustment.  Setting the new developments Allowance as the calculated and approved water demand provides the most accurate water budget and would lead to fewer exceedance citations issued and fewer adjustment requests. Requiring the Allowance to equal the approved new water demand will encourage designer(s) of new developments to produce accurate estimations to help their clients avoid Allowance exceedance penalties. The Allowance would be updated after the certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy is issued. This proposed update to the Allowance would not apply to new or enlarged pools, spas, water features, and ponds.  OutreachFive Water Neutrality Stakeholder Committee meetings were held on November 15, 2016, December 12, 2016, January 24, 2016, March 8, 2017, and April 4, 2017, where proposed requirements of the ordinance and its implementation were discussed and a consensus on recommendations was achieved. Stakeholder Committee members include representatives from water agencies, non-governmental organizations, sustainability consultants, architects, developers, manufacturers, engineers, plumbers, Los Angeles County; the Citys Water Advisory Committee, including residents; and staff from the Public Works Department, Planning and Community Development Department, and the City Attorneys Office.  Staff also presented this information to the Chamber of Commerce Governmental Affairs Committee on March 6, 2017. A public meeting was held on April 6, 2017 and 10 community members attended. A presentation was made to the North of Montana Association (NOMA) neighborhood association on April 6, 2017 and at the Mid-Cities neighborhood association on April 18, 2017. The public was notified by emails sent to all the neighborhood groups and business districts; Facebook postings, a press release, and calendar event listed on the Citys website.

The drought resulted in the lowest rainfall and snowpack since 1896. On May 27, 2008, Council adopted amendments to SMMC 7.16 - Water Conservation, which gave Council the authority to determine and declare a water supply shortage and to adopt a WSRP (Attachment C). The WSRP was developed in 2009 to comply with the States Urban Water Management Plan requirements and was based on the California Department of Water Resources 2007 Urban Drought Guidebook.  On June 9, 2009, Council adopted the WSRP (Attachment D). The WSRP was included in the Citys 2010 Urban Water Management Plan, which was subsequently approved by the State. The WSRP mandates that when Stage 1, 2, 3, or 4 water supply shortage is declared, Allowances go into effect. This mandatory conservation requires water customers to reduce use by a set percentage from a prior years water usage. The City is currently in a Stage 2 water supply shortage and Allowances are in effect that are 20% below the customers 2013 water usage. Water customers that exceed their Allowance are subject to fines and civil penalties. Adjustments to the Allowance may be granted if certain criteria including water-saving plumbing fixtures are installed. Also on June 9, 2009, Council declared a Water Shortage Advisory calling for a voluntary 10% reduction in water use in response to the drought. The Water Shortage Advisory remained in place as part of the effort to reduce the need to import water from MWD and reach the Citys goal for water self-sufficiency by 2020. In response to the continuing drought, on January 29, 2014, the City increased its voluntary conservation target from 10% to 20% (Attachment E).  On August 12, 2014, Council adopted a resolution, per Attachment F, declaring a Stage 2 Water Supply Shortage, which changed the voluntary 20% conservation target to a mandatory 20% reduction in water use. It also directed staff to return with a detailed Stage 2 Water Supply Shortage implementation plan including proposed amendments to Section 7.16 of the Municipal Code and the WSRP, a financial impact analysis to address revenue reductions, additional staffing and program implementation costs, and an implementation timeline. On October 28, 2014, staff returned to Council and presented proposed updates to the WSRP (Attachment G) as well as information about proposed changes to the Municipal Code and implementation of water shortage response measures. Council provided feedback and directed staff to return with proposed changes to the WSRP that included input from the public, a Water Conservation Unit within the Office of Sustainability and the Environment to implement the Stage 2 Water Supply Shortage, and return with proposed changes to the Municipal Code that related to water conservation.  On January 13, 2015, Council re-affirmed and re-declared a Stage 2 Water Supply Shortage and adopted updates to the WSRP (Attachment H). This included Allowances for all water customers set at 80% of their 2013 water usage for Stage 2; established penalties for exceedance of Allowances; established residential water conservation thresholds for single family and multi-family residential customers; and provided a process for adjustment of an Allowance.  On September 8, 2015, Council adopted an update to the WSRP (Attachment I). The major updates were to modify the penalty fee structure for exceeding the Allowance and to provide for waiving of the first exceedance penalty by participating in a City-offered water school. On January 1, 2017, the current California Green Building Standards went into effect in Santa Monica lowering the flow rates for plumbing fixtures including urinals and faucets. The WSRP includes specific flow rates for plumbing fixtures that must be installed in order to receive a water use allowance adjustment. On May 23, 2017, Council adopted the water neutrality ordinance (Attachment J) that requires new developments to use no more water than the current usage.

The ambassador services pilot program began on January 1, 2017 in the two parks and has had a positive impact on visitors perception of safety and cleanliness of the parks, particularly in and near the public restrooms. Data collected in the two parks in the first quarter of 2017 show that ambassadors made 4,508 quality-of-life interactions (park violations, sleeping, smoking, walkway obstructions), 26,496 hospitality interactions (transit referrals, business referrals, escorts, requests for assistance), and 17,720 maintenance-item interactions (bills/stickers, debris, graffiti, downed branches, rodents). In addition, DTSM has conducted monthly mystery-shopper evaluations to document the publics perceptions of the conditions of the parks and their experiences. The evaluations consistently report that the ambassadors were approachable, cheerful, and helpful and the public restrooms were observed as clean and presentable, with one mystery shopper stating I felt completely safe while using the facilities.  The City recently created two new public spaces adjacent to the Colorado Esplanade and Tongva Park: (a) the approximately 9,000-square-foot grassy triangle (Triangle Square) at the intersection of Main Street and Colorado Avenue (Attachment B) and (b) the approximately 4,000-square-foot pedestrian right-of-way on the eastern side of Ocean Avenue, between Colorado Avenue and the northwestern entrance to Tongva Park (Attachment C).

Among those factors were:- Ensure that all video captured by both the in-car camera system and body worn camera would be high-definition video. - The capability of the system to stream live video from the police vehicle to the Public Safety Facility while the vehicle is in motion or stopped at an incident.- The system would support the ability to securely and without any user intervention, wirelessly upload video captured by the vehicle to the secure central storage system in the Public Safety Facility.- The body worn camera would synchronize with the in-car camera system so that audio captured by the body worn camera would be interlaced with the video captured by the in-car camera system, without the need for the officers to carry an additional microphone device.- The form factor (physical size) of the body worn camera would be appropriately sized for use by officers and contained within a single device.- Battery life capability of the body worn camera was sufficient to for the device to be utilized for an entire shift (up to 12 hours).In September 2016, the Police Department embarked upon a body worn camera pilot program. The pilot program was used to assess a body worn camera program from various perspectives, including the publics perception of the use of body worn cameras, staff member feedback, and technology. The operational phase of the pilot program concluded in March 2017. The operational phase of the pilot program included the deployment of 80 body worn camera devices to various staff operating in different capacities including Police Officers, Jailers, Animal Control Officers, Pier & Harbor Services Officers, Traffic Services Officers, and Public Services Officers. Following an RFP process, the Police Department utilized State Citizens' Options for Public Safety (COPS) funding to purchase the 80 cameras from Watch Guard Video, Inc. for the pilot program. The costs for the body worn camera pilot program did not exceed the threshold requiring Council approval and therefore equipment was purchased through Purchase Orders. As part of this current purchase, the Police Department will be able to return the 80 body worn cameras initially purchased for the pilot program to receive credit towards the purchase of 330 of the newest model available. The findings of the pilot program are outlined in an Information Item published to Council on June 19, 2017. As the body worn camera pilot program progressed and the average amount of video captured on a daily basis was analyzed, it was determined that the Police Departments existing video storage system would not adequately support the projected growth that would result from implementing the proposed replacement in-car camera system and the full deployment of body worn cameras. Extrapolating the preliminary findings resulting from the body worn camera pilot program to a proposed full deployment of 330 cameras, and taking into consideration the Departments experience with the current in-car camera system, it is anticipated that both systems will generate in excess of 250 hours per day of recorded video.The Police Department worked with the Information Systems Department to identify a viable solution to support the storage needs of both the proposed new in-car cameras and body worn cameras. The proposed solution would enable video captured by either camera system, in-car or body worn, to continue to be securely transferred to a local storage server housed with the Public Safety Facility. The video would be stored locally for up to 90 days after which the video would then be automatically archived to a secure cloud-based solution integrated within the proposed in-car camera and body worn camera back-end system. The secure cloud-based storage system is hosted by Microsoft using their Azure Government Cloud platform which exceeds FBI standards for security. This proposed hybrid approach to video storage best meets the long-term needs of the Police Department. There is instant access to events occurring within 90 days and there is slightly slower access to events older than 90 days; the older footage would be archived to a secure cloud storage solution for up to the mandatory three-year retention period. Access to the video, regardless of its age, would continue to be limited to authorized staff only as determined by the Chief of Police. Vendor/Consultant SelectionIn February 2016, the City issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for body worn cameras for the pilot program and the potential full implementation of a body worn camera program in addition to the replacement of the in-car cameras for the Police Department. The RFP was posted on the Citys online bidding site and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provisions. Four firms responded and Purchase Orders were issued for the initial purchase of equipment as the costs did not exceed the threshold requiring Council approval. Responses to the RFP were reviewed by a selection panel of staff from both the Police Department and Information Systems Department. The following four firms submitted proposals:Watch Guard Video, Inc.Digital AllyPanasonicTaserThe proposals were evaluated using the following selection criteria: body worn camera integration with the in-car camera system; form factor (unit size) of the body worn camera; battery life; video recording buffer, and video quality. Based on these criteria and the criteria in SMMC 2.24.072, staff recommends Watch Guard Video, Inc. as the best qualified firm to provide 330 body worn cameras and 60 in-car cameras. Staffs recommendation is based on the well-designed and operationally functional integration between the body worn camera and the in-car camera systems, the body worn cameras form factor, battery life, video recording buffer, and video quality. The Police Department and Information Systems Department has determined that the RFP issued in February 2016 remains valid as there has been no substantive changes to the technology beyond minor software improvements.", "background": "The Police Department implemented its first in-car camera system in 2006. At the time, the system was considered state-of-the-art as it was one of the only systems to utilize a wireless upload process that securely transferred recorded video without user intervention. The first generation system was replaced in 2010 with the Police Departments current in-car system. The current system is designed around an older technology platform that is not capable of capturing high definition video. The system is no longer supported by the manufacturer and is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain and support due to the lack of available parts. The Police Department has traditionally stored all video captured by the in-car camera system on a secure local storage system housed within the Public Safety Facility, accessible only by authorized staff. Based upon a combination of State law and City policy, the Police Department retains all in-car camera, and now body worn camera video, for a period of three years.  ", "summary": "The Police Department has utilized in-car video systems since 2006. The video captured by the systems has been highly effective in helping to provide evidence of traffic violations and crimes, and has played a critical role in internal administrative investigations. The in-car camera system presently used by the Police Department is no longer supported by the manufacturer and is due for replacement. Although the in-car camera systems are highly effective, the use of body worn cameras in conjunction with in-car camera systems is now becoming an increasingly necessary tool for law enforcement. The body worn camera has the unique capability of being able to capture activity that occurs away from or out of range of a police vehicle; it is also a valuable tool for officers who utilize alternate forms of transportation such as bicycles and motorcycles. The proposed purchase of 60 in-car camera systems and 330 body worn cameras would enable the existing in-car camera system to be replaced and establish sufficient inventory to equip all field-based Police Department staff, sworn and civilian, with a body worn camera. "}, "title": " Purchase of In-Car Camera Systems and Body Worn Cameras for the Police Department.", "Sponsors": "Chief Information Officer Joseph Cevetello", "recommendations": ["Authorize the Purchasing Services Manager to issue a Purchase Order in the amount of $696,488 to Watch Guard Video, Inc., a Texas-based company for the purchase of 60 in-car camera systems and 330 body worn camera systems, related accessories and supplies, and software.", ".

Consent Calendar", "body": {"other": "Project ComponentsThe project consists of two distinct components, the Pier outfall improvements and the Pico-Kenter outfall improvements. Staff proposes eliminating the Pico-Kenter improvements from the Project scope as discussed in the Value Engineering section later in this staff report. This is because the water quality benefits of the Pico-Kenter outfall improvements are achieved by the future Sustainable Water Infrastructure Project (SWIP) to a much larger scale, and because the best bid is in excess of the available budget.FIGURE 1  PROJECT SITES Pier OutfallThe Pier outfall discharges stormwater and urban runoff from the 106-acre Santa Monica Downtown area to the Santa Monica Bay. The Pier outfall runs under the south edge of the Santa Monica Pier. The Project would divert all of the runoff from the downtown area into a 1,600,000-gallon underground cistern. The size of the cistern was calculated using the 85th percentile storm event, or a 1-inch, 24-hour storm event, in Downtown Santa Monica, excluding the existing stormwater mitigation structures. A diversion structure and pipeline under the Pier and the beach parking Lot 1 North would be built to convey the runoff to the new cistern. The underground cistern would be constructed in the undeveloped vacant lot north of the existing Beach Maintenance Yard (known as the Deauville Site), (Figure 1). As part of the project, the Deauville Site would be developed into a paved public parking lot, acting functionally as an expansion of the existing Lot 1 North. Approximately 111 new parking spaces would be available at this location. This would increase the lot capacity by 9.5%. The harvested runoff water would be conveyed to SMURRF by a new pressure main line to be built beneath Appian Way as part of the Project. The treated water would be distributed for non-potable use such as irrigation and toilet flushing.FIGURE 2  PIER OUTFALL AND DEAUVILLE LOT Pico-Kenter Outfall The improvements that are being proposed for elimination from the Project scope include a new 80,000-gallon underground cistern, a new wastewater line and a maintenance access driveway at the Pico/Kenter outfall.FIGURE 3  PICO/KENTER OUTFALL (eliminated from scope) The Project would provide multiple benefits that include: reducing a significant amount of stormwater and runoff urban discharges to the ocean; improving beach water quality in the Santa Monica Bay, thereby enhancing the visitor experience at the beach; advancing compliance with the MS4 permit and Enhanced Watershed Management Program (EWMP) requirements; generating a new water resource; increasing beach parking capacity; and improving beach access.  Return on Investment AnalysisThe return on investment analysis considers a 30-year life cycle and the following factors against the total cost of construction:-          The savings from avoided imported water costs when operating SMURRF at full capacity, -          Maintenance and operation cost of the project,-          Sewer fees associated with use of sewer discharges.Due to the Citys ongoing conservation efforts the dry-weather urban runoff that is used as the source water at the SMURRF has been measurably reduced. Designed to produce up to 500,000 gallons/day, which is 560 acre-feet per year (AFY), SMURRF receives only 110,000 gallons/day (124 AFY) source water, which is limited to dry-weather conditions due to the limitations of diversion capacity. In order to meet the production capacity of SMURRF, 436 AFY of supplemental make up water (i.e. potable supply) is required. Tier I imported water currently costs the City approximately $1,303/AFY, which includes base price, transportation, and commodity. At the first year of the project, annual savings from avoided imported water costs would be $568,108. Estimated maintenance and operations costs are $100,000 per fiscal year. Estimated annual sewer fees are $56,000. Assumed annual escalation rates are 2% for O&M costs, 2% for sewer fees, and 7% for imported water cost. All future values for cumulative annual costs were discounted at a rate of 3% per year, accounting for the difference between inflation and the cost of money, and summarized for the 30-year study. The total net present worth of the project would result in $12,315,132 in savings over the life cycle of the project as summarized in the tables below. Construction Cost($14,856,970)Annual O&M Cost($100,000)Annual Sewer Fee($56,000)Savings $568,108  Construction Cost($14,856,970)Present Value of Cumulative Annual O&M Cost -escalated at 2% for 30 years (*)($2,613,553)Present Value of Annual Sewer Fee -escalated at 2% for 30 years (*)($1,463,590)Present Value of Savings from Avoided Imported Water Cost - escalated at 7% for 30 years (*)$31,249,245(*) Discounted at 3% for 30 Years Protection of the Santa Monica Bay and Regulatory ComplianceThe Federal Clean Water Act (CWA) requires the State Water Control Board to develop water quality standards that identify beneficial uses within its region. Beneficial uses include swimming, fishing, drinking water, navigability, and wildlife habitats and reproduction. CWA section 402 requires the issuance of a permit to regulate municipal stormwater discharges, known as the MS4 permit. As part of MS4 permit compliance efforts the City of Santa Monica and Cities of Los Angeles, El Segundo, Los Angeles County Flood Control District and the County of Los Angeles jointly developed the Enhanced Watershed Management Program (EWMP) for Jurisdictional Groups 2 & 3 of the Santa Monica Bay watershed. EWMP is a comprehensive program that is expected to improve water quality through the planning and implementation of multi-benefit, regional projects and low impact development strategies in the watershed area. Multi-benefit, regional projects (EWMP Projects) would be designed to retain runoff generated by the 85th percentile 24-hour storm event on the drainage areas tributary to the projects, while also achieving other benefits such as flood control and water supply. The Clean Beaches Project would allow for improved beach water quality by harvesting and treating stormwater that is currently discharged to the Santa Monica Bay. The Project would assist the City in its efforts for compliance with the stormwater non-point source discharge requirements set forth in the final amended Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permit. The MS4 permit defines a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) as the maximum amount of a pollutant that a body of water can receive. Established TMDLs for Santa Monica Bay include coliform bacteria, DDT (pesticide), PCBs (manufactured organic chemicals), and debris. The SWRCB monitors and enforces the MS4 permit compliance.  Due to its limited diversion capacity, SMURRF currently captures and treats dry weather runoff, and only a small amount of wet weather runoff. This has resulted in wet-weather bacterial TMDL exceedances near the Santa Monica Pier Outfall. The Project would ameliorate these conditions by harvesting up to 1.6 MG of storm water from any single event for advanced treatment, recycling and reuse. The proposed tanks would harvest the 85th percentile storm volume from the Pier basin (106 acres). This Project was modeled in and is consistent with, the EWMP for the Pier drainage basin.  Construction Schedule and ImpactsProject construction is expected to start in September 2017. The Project duration is anticipated to be one year and is expected to be completed by August 2018. Project specific construction requirements were mandated by the City and they require the contractor to minimize impacts to Beach Parking Lot 1 North during special events. Additionally, during trenching and pipeline installation, the contractor would not be allowed to impact more than 50 parking spaces on a weekday and not more than 25 parking spaces during the weekends and holidays. For special events, such as the Independent Spirit Awards Ceremony, the Contractor would be required to backfill and patch all open trenches prior to the event.  Public Outreach during the Design PhaseThroughout the project design phase, City staff met with Shutters Hotel management, Casa Del Mar Hotel management, and managers of Pier businesses. At these meetings, City staff discussed Project impacts, received feedback, and implemented stakeholders suggestions resulting in adjusted working hours and seasonal work and noise level restrictions. In addition, City Staff met with the Pier Board and the Pier Tenants during the design phase and as a result of their feedback, the parking restrictions mentioned above have been incorporated into the construction documents.  California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) On January 28, 2015, a Notice of Exemption (NOE) was filed with the Los Angeles County Clerks office by the Citys Planning & Community Development Department providing a Categorical Exemption for the project under Sections 15303 (Class 3) OF CEQA guidelines and 210801.35 of the California Environmental Quality Act. Contractor Selection - Construction ServicesOn January 24, 2017, the City issued a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for general engineering contractors specializing in civil and mechanical work with experience constructing reservoirs, deep utility excavations, and dewatering projects. The RFQ was posted on the Citys on-line bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provisions. Fourteen firms responded (see Attachment C). Responses to the RFQ were reviewed by a selection panel consisting of staff from the Public Works department.  The evaluation was based on the quality exhibited and experience of the prime contractor, including: their safety and regulatory compliance record; financial capacity, including insurance and bonding; quality control; and experience with similar projects. On March 9, 2017, the City issued a letter pre-qualifying five firms for the construction services on the project, as follows:-          Powel Constructors, Inc.-          Reyes Construction, Inc.-          Steve Bubalo Construction Co.-          Steve P. Rados, Inc.-          W. A. Rasic Construction Co., Inc. On March 15, 2017, the City issued Notices Inviting Bids with Bid #SP2356 for the Clean Beaches Project for Pier and Pico/Kenter Watersheds, via email, to the five pre-qualified contractors.  Five bids were received and publicly opened on May 3, 2017. Bid results are as follows: Bidder     Base Bid ___Reyes Construction, Inc.  $14,856,970Steve Bubalo  Construction Co. $15,547,800Powell Constructors , Inc.  $15,802,745Steve P. Rados, Inc.  $16,000,000W.A. Rasic Construction Co., Inc. $16,825,000Updated Engineers Estimate $10,876,220 Staff recommends Reyes Construction, Inc. as the best bidder, based on its lowest price, quality of services offered, and experience with similar projects. Reyes Construction, Inc. provided four references for recently completed projects, and a similar number of on-going projects for the City of Lakewood, City of Long Beach, and Orange County. Staff reached out to the references provided and all those contacted reported that the work performed by Reyes Construction, Inc. was completed in a timely and cost-effective manner while maintaining consistent quality. The Contractors State License Board also verified that the Contractor and subcontractors licenses are current, active, and in good standing. Value EngineeringThe difference in cost between the bid received and the updated engineers estimate can be attributed to the following factors:          Construction duration limited to approximately nine months (270 working days) which obligated the contractor to assume additional cost risks,          Cost associated with construction phasing requirements to reduce construction impact to adjacent businesses,          Unforeseen significantly high costs specific to the dewatering, shoring and pre-cast materials;          Extremely unique conditions of the project site being under the pier and on the beach environment where high pedestrian volumes exist,          High demand in the construction market in Los Angeles County. Staff believes the bid received is a reasonable and fair cost to perform this project. However, since the bid received was in excess of the available budget, staff has contacted the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) CBI Grant Management to discuss reducing the project scope related to the Pico-Kenter Outfall. The Project scope at Pico-Kenter includes construction of an 80,000-gallon cistern to harvest storm water and urban runoff, and a maintenance access driveway that would improve operations to dissipate the ponding water at the discharge point of the outfall. The City is currently pursuing the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Program (SWIP), which includes harvesting and treating up to 4.5 million gallons of stormwater and urban runoff from the Pico-Kenter watershed. The SWIP project would provide water quality benefits for the Pico-Kenter Watershed at a much larger scale and better cost effectiveness. SWRCB CBI Grant Management supports the possibility of a proposed scope reduction by eliminating the Pico-Kenter component of this Project.  In order to decrease the project cost, staff recommends that the project scope related to Pico-Kenter outfall be eliminated. Staff recommends that a construction contract with Reyes Construction be executed in an amount of $14,856,970 (bid amount) with approval for a deductive change order to reduce project scope. The cost savings of the reduced project scope is estimated to be between $2.6M and $3M. From the estimated cost savings, staff would reserve 10% of the amended construction contract amount as contingency. Consultant Selection - Construction ManagementOn September 22, 2015, the City issued a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for construction management and inspection services for upcoming construction projects on the Citys online bidding website and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provisions. A total of 1,674 vendors were notified and 124 vendors downloaded the RFQ. The City received 25 proposals. Responses to the RFQ were reviewed by a selection panel of staff from the Civil Engineering Division of the Public Works Department. The evaluation was based on the selection criteria set forth in SMMC Section 2.24.073, with the specific review of the following:  technical competence, staffing capability, project approach, past performance, dispute resolution, quality control, cost control, management services, customer service, and the ability to meet the required time frames. The top 4 firms were placed on a pre-qualified list of construction management firms in the Storm Drain category. This list includes Anderson-Penna, Arcadis, CWE, and GK and Associates. These four firms were invited to participate in a Request for Proposal (RFP) phase on February 15, 2017.  On March 8, 2017, Anderson-Penna, CWE, and GK and Associates submitted proposals. The Citys three-person review committee from the Civil Engineering Division reviewed and graded the firms and proposals based on the selection criteria set forth in SMMC 2.24.073. The committee is recommending GK and Associates as the best-qualified firm to provide construction management and inspection services based on its qualifications and its directly related experience providing similar services for other municipal agencies. GK and Associates has extensive knowledge and experience on numerous construction projects in the cities of Brea, Downey, South Pasadena, Bradbury, Pico Rivera, Lancaster, Whittier, Baldwin Park, Las Vegas, Temecula, Norwalk, Colton, Whittier, and Cerritos. Services provided by GK and Associates would include construction management services, continuous inspection of the contractors work, verification and management of field changes and unforeseen conditions, monitoring and mitigation of impacts as a result of the construction activities, attendance at the construction contractors safety meetings, attendance at periodic progress meetings, recordkeeping of all necessary inspection documentation relevant to the work performed during construction, materials testing, and public outreach.  Public Outreach - During ConstructionPublic outreach during construction of this Project would be provided by the City and by the Citys construction management consultant as part of the construction management effort. GK and Associates partnered with Curtis Pringle and Associates for public outreach. The City would work with the consultant team to keep all neighboring businesses and residents fully informed of the project schedule and construction impacts.  The City and the consultant team would frequently meet with Pier businesses in the project vicinity to keep them aware of project impacts. Public outreach would include notifications distributed to adjacent properties and the surrounding community regarding the scope of the Project, and schedule periodic updates on the Citys Know Before You Go (aka KBUG) website and Monday editions of the Santa Monica Daily Press. Notifications would also be posted on social media and in local newspapers. Businesses impacted by the Project would receive two construction notices. The first general notice would be hand-delivered to properties adjacent to the proposed Project two weeks prior to the start of construction. A second two-day notice would be subsequently hand-delivered to each adjacent property with detailed information regarding the planned construction activity, potential impacts, and contact information. The notices would be prepared and distributed by the construction management, public relations consultant. Staff will also utilize the project website, as in the Attachment D. Second Modification of the Tetra Tech, Inc.s PSA  #10283 - Control System Integration and Development of Storm Forecasting & Monitoring ToolsTetra Tech supported the City of Santa Monica (City) with the development of conceptual design, design documents, and design support services for the Project. A second modification of $160,000 to Professional Services Agreement No. 10283 (CCS) with Tetra Tech, Inc. is required to complete the control systems integration and development of the storm forecasting and monitoring tools. This would result in a new total amount not to exceed $759,304. The scope of work is explained in the following sections: -          Control Systems IntegrationAn industrial process control system known as SCADA is an automated computer control system that allows remote operation and control of system equipment and facilities. Currently, the City owns and operates a SCADA system that was specifically developed to integrate the water and wastewater telemetering and remote control systems. The SCADA system controls and monitors many of the critical operating functions such as reservoir and wet well levels, pump speeds, and intrusion alarms as necessary to enhance operational efficiencies and control capabilities. Tetra Tech and its sub consultants would provide services to integrate the new facility controls of the Project with the Citys existing SCADA system. Tetra Tech would provide start-up and system testing for both facilities; screens for viewing instrument data and validate the screen data to the field instruments.  -          Development of the storm forecasting and monitoring toolsThe additional scope of work would be for forecasting and monitoring local weather, as well as monitoring the proposed stormwater facilities. Continuous monitoring would enable City staff to track and optimize cumulative performance over time by operating the facilities in response to real-time conditions. The valuable data collected during continuous monitoring would also support annual reporting of water quality improvement progress to the Regional Water Quality Control Board. Along with the continuous monitoring equipment in the proposed stormwater facilities, the City would implement forecast-based control using predicted rainfalland resulting runoffto inform system operation. The exercise would analyze historical SMURRF operations data to evaluate the scenarios under which system performance could potentially be optimized by adaptive controls. Concurrent with assessment and installation of automated real-time control components, Tetra Tech would develop a simplified forecasting tool to predict impending runoff at regular intervals and inform the manual operation of the facility. The tool would run at scheduled intervals to provide City staff and operators with weather forecast updates via email. Both concepts discussed above would rely on a watershed model to translate rainfall forecasts to reliable runoff volumes and flow rates.The additional scope of work would help the City meet the needs for development of an adaptive control analysis, a web-based dashboard, and a simple forecast-based decision-support tool based on the best available watershed modeling. Project FundingThe Project would utilize the State Water Resource Control Boards (SWRCB) Clean Beaches Initiative (CBI) Grant, Measure V funds, and the funds from the Olympic Treatment Plant project account originally budgeted in Capital Improvement Program budget in FY2016-17 and in FY2017-18. These funds were originally allocated towards the feasibility, design, environmental, permitting, and construction costs of a proposed new standalone water treatment facility, known as the Olympic Treatment Plant (OTP). The proposed plant location was in the east portion of the Citys Michigan Avenue Maintenance Yards complex (City Yards). In concept, OTP would provide the City a means of treating an additional 3.5 million gallons of water per day, while simultaneously expediting the cleanup of impaired groundwater quality in the Citys Olympic well field caused by historic industrial releases. A final feasibility report, prepared by the Hathaway Dinwiddie and Black & Veatch consultant team, determined that the cost for the new subgrade OTP facility could exceed $80M; and costs were roughly double that figure for other potential surface improvements related to the City Yards and Gandara Park. Costs for construction of the OTP at the City Yards site were driven largely by the engineering complexities related to subsurface construction, site geotechnical challenges, environmental remediation, and State drinking water regulations. As an alternative, staff initiated a feasibility study to assess modifying and/or expanding the Citys existing Arcadia Treatment Facility to achieve the same treatment capacity and clean up goals as the proposed OTP. Based on the preliminary engineering report it was determined that modification of the Arcadia facility is feasible at significantly lower costs than the proposed OTP. Based on the feasibility and cost savings by expanding Arcadia and not pursuing the OTP, staff has withdrawn the proposed OTP from inclusion in the City Yards Master Plan. This frees up a majority of OTP funds for use on other critical water sustainability projects such as the Clean Beaches Project, which requires an allocation of $6.64M. The remaining balance of the available OTP funds would be reserved for the development of alternative water resources and related projects such as indirect potable reuse (IPR), deep monitoring wells, numerical aquifer fate and transport modeling, water treatment facility telemetry, parcel acquisition for the siting of distributed water infrastructure related to the IPR, and regulatory testing and reporting needed in order to achieve SWRCB approval for IPR via aquifer recharge, all of which are  a key components in the strategy for achieving water sustainability by 2020.", "background": "Federal, State, and local regulations require the City to reduce urban runoff pollution from storm drain discharges into the Santa Monica Bay. Recent regulatory changes adopted by the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board implemented regulations that set stringent limits on the Los Angeles County Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) discharges in order to improve ocean water quality. Furthermore, the City has established, among its sustainability goals, achieving water self-sufficiency by 2020 through continued conservation and innovative reuse of all water resources available to the City to end its reliance on imported water. The Project would help the City achieve these sustainability objectives while simultaneously improving beach water quality to meet the requirements of the MS4 permit. On January 27, 2015, the Council authorized staff to apply for and accept grant funds from the SWRCB Clean Beaches Initiative (CBI) Grant Program, per Attachment A.

The harvested water would be treated at the Santa Monica Urban Runoff Recycling Facility (SMURRF) for non-potable uses such as irrigation and toilet flushing. The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) awarded the City of Santa Monica a grant from the Clean Beaches Initiative Grant Program for the implementation of the Project.

Ordinances", "body": {"other": "The City requires ambulance services, and is not currently equipped to take over the services Ameri-Care provides. Contractors who provide emergency ambulance services to the City are different from other City contractors subject to the LWO because emergency ambulance providers do not control rates for the services they provide. Rather, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors sets rates for all emergency transport services. The Board adjusts rates annually based on changes to the medical care and transportation line items of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers and, starting July 1, 2017, the percentage change of the Los Angeles County minimum wage change. The County rates are the maximum allowable ambulance rates chargeable to the general public. Thus, while there is an established methodology for increasing rates that takes into account some wage changes, these factors do not include the higher Santa Monica living wage. Additionally, revenue collected by ambulance companies is dependent on the insurance payer mix of the patients transported. Payer mix varies from community to community, and in Santa Monica, approximately one third of payers are Medicare and another third MediCal recipients. These payers pay considerably less to the ambulance company than what is billed. All of these factors, in addition to employee wages, influence the bottom line of any ambulance company providing services in this community.  Some nonprofit organizations rely on State or federal reimbursement and would face similar challenges; these organizations are exempt from the Citys LWO. The Citys MWO applies to all businesses, including nonprofit organizations that rely on federal or State funding or externally set reimbursements. The MWO provides a longer ramp-up period for those organizations, with the intent that they then have more time to adjust operations, and for reimbursement rates to reflect new laws. Based on the industry structure and the Citys need for an ambulance services provider, staff recommends that Council amend the LWO to exempt ambulance services for a period of three years. These organizations would still be required to comply with the MWO. This delay would provide time for the industry to adjust to the higher wage model, and would coincide with the minimum wages scheduled $15 per hour target in 2020. The recommendation is consistent with prior Council action to exempt banking services in that it is targeted based on specific industry characteristics. It is also consistent with the treatment of nonprofit organizations in the LWO and MWO, some of which share the challenge of externally established service charge rates over which the organizations have no control. Finally, this recommendation is in keeping with the concept of harmonizing the Citys minimum wage, hotel wage, and living wage in the longer term as discussed with the Citys minimum wage law. If Council approves staffs recommendation, staff will issue a new RFP based on the updated LWO. A new RFP process that reflects Council action on the LWO will be clear and will maximize the Citys chances of attracting proposals. The six-month extension reflects the estimated time needed to conduct a new RFP process. AlternativesCouncil could choose to not amend the LWO. The City would move forward with bidding out a new contract for emergency ambulance and billing services and require any contractor selected to comply with the LWO. Staff does not recommend this as it could result in no responses, which would leave the City without emergency medical transportation. In addition to the three-year exemption, Council could direct staff to consider other options for emergency transport and billing services provision, including whether to bring services in house. Such a direction could decrease the incentive to bid on the Citys RFP. ", "background": "The Living Wage Ordinance (LWO), Santa Monica Municipal Code Chapter 4.65, requires that any contractor providing services to the City of Santa Monica pursuant to a contract in the amount of Fifty-Four Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($54,200.00) or more shall pay at least the minimum wage, as defined by the LWO, to any employee working on that contract for work done on the contract. The LWO currently exempts government agencies, City grantees and other non-profit corporations, and banking services, and provides for a waiver for employees of contractors participating in a bona fide collective bargaining agreement. Although not exempted at the time of the LWOs adoption, the City Council approved an exemption for banking services in 2008 after staff surveyed major banking institutions and determined that none could certify compliance with the LWO. At the time the exemption was added, staff also surveyed other jurisdictions and determined that banking services were not subject to living wage requirements for various reasons. The Minimum Wage Ordinance (MWO), Santa Monica Municipal Code Chapter 4.62, requires payment of the Citys Minimum Wage to Employees, defined as anyone working two hours or more in a given week in Santa Monica. The MWO exempts government agencies and all other public entities, and provides limited exemptions for smaller businesses and nonprofits (a one-year delay in the wage schedule), and a limited exemption for employers providing transitional jobs for the hardest to employ. The MWO also provides for a waiver for employees of contractors participating in a bona fide collective bargaining agreement. The City has used an external provider for emergency ambulance and billing services since the inception of the paramedic program in the 1980s. Contracted emergency ambulances are used to transport patients on behalf of the Fire Department with Santa Monica Fire Department paramedics on board to provide patient treatment in the ambulance while en route to a medical facility. The Citys response time and staff requirements mean that service providers must offer 24-hour staffing and at least six vehicles stationed at one place in Santa Monica. Service providers bill recipients directly so that there is no cost to the City associated with transport service. The provider also manages billing for City fees associated with Emergency Medical Services provided by Fire Department paramedics in connection with the response, assessment, and treatment of members of the public. Staff estimates receiving approximately $0.8 million in associated revenue in FY 2016-17. Ameri-Care has served as the Citys ambulance transport and billing provider since 2011.

One potential proposer notified the City that they would not submit a proposal due to their inability to comply with the LWO requirement. City staff subsequently reached out to other service providers and concluded that industry standard pay, including that of the Citys current provider, does not comply with the Citys LWO. In light of the information received, staff cancelled the RFP.

Administrative Item", "body": {"other": "The Recreation and Parks Commission considered the temporary and permanent multipurpose Civic Center sports field options at its June 15, 2017 meeting and approved a motion to recommend to Council that it direct staff to move forward with development of the temporary field option.  Feasibility Analysis and Design ConceptsAn interdepartmental team of City and SMMUSD staff conducted intensive discussions and collaborated with consultants from RJM Design to determine the feasibility of two options for a multipurpose sports field at the Civic Center: a temporary field with no new parking spaces added and a permanent field with subterranean parking. Option 1: Temporary Multipurpose Sports Field at the Civic CenterThe temporary field option (Exhibit 1) would feature a regulation size multipurpose sports field at grade with dimensions comparable to the existing field at Airport Park (225 x 360). The feasibility analysis determined a softball field overlay could be accommodated on the site with a 225 centerfield line and a 200 foul line. Due to site constraints, the softball infield would be composed of synthetic turf rather than the traditional clay material to allow soccer and other sports to be played on the field. Other amenities would include lighting, fencing and containment netting around the perimeter of the field (approximate combined height of 26), a portable restroom trailer, temporary storage space, temporary spectator seating, a moveable homerun fence, and chain-link dugouts and bullpens. Access to the temporary field site would be provided through the existing Civic Center Drive and Main Street parking lot entrances. The existing emergency ingress and egress at Pico Boulevard would be retained.   This option would present significant challenges due to the amount of surface parking displaced. A comprehensive parking study of the area surrounding the Civic Center, including the Downtown, would be needed to demonstrate that the loss of parking would not impede coastal access in order to secure approval of a Coastal Development Permit from the California Coastal Commission. Additionally, City staff, Santa Monica High School (Samohi) faculty and students, and visitors to the Civic Center who currently park in the lot would be displaced and alternative arrangements would need to be considered. The Courthouse would also be affected by the displacement of parking and its administration has expressed serious concerns with the project as proposed as well as with other upcoming development projects within the Civic Center (further detailed below), citing the need for employee parking and accessible parking for patrons visiting the court to serve jury duty and seek legal assistance. Furthermore, the significant parking loss could likely impact future reuse of the Civic Auditorium as prospective private partners may consider the venue to be an unfavorable investment without sufficient convenient parking. Based on the feasibility study and concept design, it is estimated the temporary multipurpose sports field would cost approximately $8.6 million. This estimate includes the aforementioned amenities, projected future cost escalation, and an allowance for hazardous material removal and remediation. The estimate is considerably higher than previous estimates as it includes costs associated with adding the softball field overlay, contingency for design development, and site constraint construction cost premiums that were not originally included in earlier project cost estimates. Additionally, the construction market has experienced a period of inflated costs due to a surge in demand and a shortage of labor, resulting in increased escalation projections.  If this option were selected, next steps would include:          Environmental review pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), amending the Civic Center Specific Plan (CCSP) as needed, completing design and construction documents with RJM Design to definitively determine funding needs for the FY 2018-2020 CIP budget. Staff would return to Council as necessary to award a contract for this work.         Conducting the aforementioned parking study in preparation for Coastal Commission review at an estimated cost of $250,000 (currently unbudgeted). Undertaking and managing this unanticipated step would require a considerable amount of staff time and would divert staff resources from other efforts. Staff would return to Council as necessary to identify funds and award a contract to a parking consultant following a competitive selection process.         Discussions with SMMUSD to determine whether they would participate in the development of the temporary field and provide funding to support the softball overlay for Samohi use (a SMMUSD priority).         Discussions with Courthouse staff to address alternatives to lost surface parking both during and following construction. Construction of the temporary field would potentially begin in March 2020 with the field opening in March 2021. Given the need for a comprehensive parking study, Coastal Commission review and approval, appropriate environmental review, and amendment of the CCSP to address the field setback along Pico Boulevard, the timeline is a realistic estimate but could be subject to change if any unforeseen circumstances are encountered. Additionally, the timeline presents challenges given the schedules of other construction projects planned in the Civic Center, with projects overlapping at times from September 2017 through March 2021 (see chart below). If these projects were constructed simultaneously, special attention would need to be paid to ensure there is sufficient and safe workspace for each project zone and contractor laydown and storage areas would need to be accommodated onsite and/or offsite. It is important to note excessive site constraints typically result in substantially higher construction costs and could result in project delays. Furthermore, with overlapping construction schedules, the Civic Center surface parking lot would be largely unavailable for an extended period. City Services Building (CSB)September 2017Spring 2020Early Childhood Education Lab School (ECLS)Late 2017 / early 2018Summer 2019Sustainable Water Infrastructure Project (SWIP)April 2019October 2020Temporary Multipurpose Sports FieldMarch 2020March 2021  Option 2: Permanent Multipurpose Sports Field at the Civic Center with Two Levels of Subterranean Parking The permanent sports field option (Exhibit 2) would also feature a regulation size soccer/multipurpose sports field at grade with dimensions comparable to the existing field at Airport Park and a softball field overlay with a 225 centerfield line and a 200 foul line. Similar to the temporary field option, the permanent softball infield would be composed of synthetic turf rather than the traditional clay material. Other amenities would include lighting, containment fencing and netting around the perimeter of the field (approximate combined height of 26), a permanent structure with restrooms and storage space, spectator seating, a moveable homerun fence, dugouts, and bullpens.   Most notably, the permanent sports field option would provide approximately 700  725 spaces of subterranean parking on two levels. The parking structure would be accessed by a ramp adjacent to the westerly edge of the Early Childhood Lab School site (ECLS; formerly named the ECEC). To accommodate access to the parking structure ramp, Civic Center Drive would be extended through the parking lot to Main Street and the existing Main Street driveway would be permanently closed as contemplated by the CCSP. A bike connection from Pico Boulevard to Civic Center Drive would be included and would run between the westerly edge of the field and the Civic Auditorium. The permanent field and parking structure has been estimated to cost approximately $95.4 million including escalation to the midpoint of construction and would include the aforementioned amenities and site improvements as well as earthwork and underground utility relocation to allow for two levels of subterranean parking. This estimate is higher than the previous estimate of $80  84 million and is attributed to recent marked inflation in the construction industry and inclusion of costs associated with the softball field overlay, contingency for design development, projected future cost escalation, site constraint construction cost premiums, and a higher allocation for relocation of underground utilities. The cost to construct the parking garage is estimated to be approximately 91% of the total project cost. Given the Councils commitment to constructing additional sports fields as part of the Airport Park expansion and the Citys other capital project obligations, the Citys financial contribution of nearly $48 million towards construction of a permanent field with subterranean parking would need to come from passage of a potential local general obligation bond in November 2018. This would require two-thirds voter approval and this project alone would constitute a large portion of the proposed citywide park funding measure. On April 25, 2017, Council directed staff to pursue the concept of a park funding measure, including conducting polling (Attachment F). A decision by Council whether to put a measure on the November 2018 ballot would be required by August 2018.  If this option were selected, next steps would include completing the environmental analysis, ending RJM Designs contract, and issuing an RFP for full design and engineering services for the permanent field and parking facility. The RFP would incorporate the need for cost estimating services to more definitively estimate costs commensurate with design development. Construction of the permanent field could potentially begin in September 2020 and would be completed in approximately 24 months. Given the need for a comprehensive parking study, Coastal Commission review and approval, appropriate environmental review, and amendment of the CCSP to address the location of the sports field and subterranean parking (both are proposed for locations that differ from what was contemplated in the CCSP), the timeline is a realistic estimate but could be subject to change if any unforeseen circumstances are encountered.  Moreover, as described below in the proposed partnership with SMMUSD, the Board of Education would need to determine if the permitting process would necessitate the involvement of the Division of the State Architect (DSA) since students may use the multipurpose sports field for physical education during school hours. It is important to note that DSA approval commonly takes 12 months from plan submittal to permit issuance, and could delay the project schedule as well as add further costs. Similar to the temporary field, the construction of the permanent field would take place during a time when the City Services Building and the SWIP project are also under construction in the Civic Center area (see chart below).  City Services Building (CSB)September 2017Spring 2020Early Childhood Education Lab School (ECLS)Late 2017 / early 2018Summer 2019Sustainable Water Infrastructure Project (SWIP)April 2019October 2020Permanent Multipurpose Sports Field with ParkingSeptember 2020September 2022 Given that these projects are proposed concurrently and would entail the temporary elimination of surface parking during overlapping construction periods, alternatives for replacement parking would need to be addressed for current Civic Center parking users. Proposed Partnership with SMMUSDSince receiving direction from Council at the October 25, 2016 meeting, City staff have met regularly with SMMUSD staff to discuss and negotiate proposed terms that would be included in a joint use agreement for the permanent multipurpose sports field and subterranean parking structure. Should Council choose to move forward with this option, proposed terms would be as follows:         The joint use agreement term would be 55-years with a possible 45-year option to extend for use of the sports field.          To expedite the project SMMUSD would advance up to $4 million for design and pre-construction costs with the expectation that the City would reimburse SMMUSD for the Citys pro rata share of these costs as determined by the economic analysis (discussed in the next section of the report), regardless of whether the City obtains local voter approval for bond financing.          The City and SMMUSD would each pay its pro rata share of construction costs with the understanding that construction of the project would be contingent upon local voter approval of the parks bond measure.         City would oversee and manage all aspects of the design and construction of the project through a collaborative process with SMMUSD participation. If DSA approval were determined to be a necessary component of the project, a DSA inspector would need to be hired to be onsite during construction.         City would retain land ownership and would own the sports field and subterranean parking structure.         City would oversee all operations and maintenance functions of the field and the subterranean parking structure.         SMMUSD would have exclusive use of the sports field Monday through Friday from 2:30 pm to 6:00 pm on operational school days.         SMMUSD would have exclusive rights to use a specified number of guaranteed parking spaces (anticipated need being 300 or fewer spaces) on Monday through Friday, reserved until 10:00 am, during the regular academic year (from the first day of instruction in August to the last day of instruction in June). After 10:00 am, the spaces not occupied would be made available to the general public; this would require additional management by staff and/or with technology. The number of guaranteed parking spaces needed outside of the regular academic year would be far fewer. SMMUSD would not compensate the City for use of the guaranteed parking spaces.         SMMUSD would receive an allocation of parking validations for up to 25 special events, the exact amount of which has yet to be negotiated.         SMMUSD would agree to comply with the City's Transportation Demand Management Ordinance (SMMC Chapter 9.53) terms as a condition of exclusive use of the reserved parking spaces.  Economic AnalysisThe proposed terms for use of the permanent field and parking were considered in an economic analysis conducted by a team of consultants from Allan D. Kotin & Associates and Economic & Planning Systems (EPS). The economic analysis was commissioned to determine the overall financial feasibility of the permanent field project and an equitable basis for the City and SMMUSD to share costs associated with the projects development (Attachment G). The analysis examined the net cash flow of the existing condition and projected net cash flow of the temporary field for comparison. In addition to proposed field and parking usage plans, the economic analysis studied capital costs, projected maintenance, operational parking and field costs, projected revenues, and projected savings SMMUSD would achieve by avoiding building parking and a softball field on the Samohi campus.  Given these considerations, the analysis recommended the City and SMMUSD each contribute 50% of the total project costs, based upon the following assumptions:1.      The City would realize all potential parking revenues by the end of the 55-year lease term;2.     SMMUSD would complete its master plan to construct permanent parking on the Samohi campus by 2044; and3.     SMMUSD would not be required to pay for use of any guaranteed parking spaces in the Civic Center parking lot until its debt to finance the project is retired (anticipated to occur by 2045).  Given the pro rata share, initial calculations, and current project cost estimates, development of a permanent field at the Civic Center would cost SMMUSD and the City approximately $47.7 million each. As noted previously, the Citys contribution would be dependent upon passage of a local bond measure. While it is premature to identify the ultimate size of such a local bond measure, it is clear that a sizable portion of a future funding measure would be required to realize a project of this magnitude. Other priority park needs identified by the community such as the construction of the 12-acre expansion of Airport Park, the expansion of Memorial Park, and land acquisition for new parks, could potentially be deferred if sufficient funding is not available. If voters do not approve such a bond measure, the City would still need to reimburse SMMUSD for 50% of the design costs expended. The economic analysis used the aforementioned pro rata share to determine the projected net cash flow for each party for the proposed 55-year term of the joint use agreement (2020 through 2075) for a comparative analysis of existing conditions, a temporary sports field, and a permanent field with subterranean parking. The financial impacts of constructing either a temporary field or the permanent multipurpose sports field with subterranean parking on the Civic Center parking lot would be significant. If a permanent field were built, it is estimated the Citys net cash flow, assuming present value rates, would be -$43.9 million over the full 55-year joint use agreement term. SMMUSDs net cash flow would be -$4.8 million over the 55-year term of the agreement.  If a temporary field were built, it is estimated the Citys net cash flow would be -$16.7 million over a 55-year term. To ensure consistency, the economic analysis calculated SMMUSDs net cash flow for the temporary field as well (-$6.1 million over a 55-year term), with the assumption the City would finance 100% of the temporary project. However, it is important to note the City and SMMUSD staff have not discussed a potential partnership for the temporary field. Furthermore, because the temporary project eliminates most of the surface parking on the Civic Center lot, the project would not provide SMMUSD with guaranteed access to a predetermined number of parking spaces, which is arguably the most valuable financial benefit to SMMUSD of the proposed permanent field and parking partnership.  AlternativesThe economic analysis illustrates the immediate and long-term financial impacts that both the permanent and temporary multipurpose sports field options would have on the City and SMMUSD. Given the significant investment and risk that would be required by both agencies, staff recommends Council consider the benefits and costs of each of the aforementioned scenarios as well as the following possible alternatives: Alternative 1: Permanent Multipurpose Sports Field at the Civic Center with One Level of Subterranean ParkingOne alternative is a permanent multipurpose sports field with the softball field overlay and one level (approximately 325 spaces) of subterranean parking. The preliminary estimated capital cost of this alternative is $60 million and the project timeline would be similar to that of the permanent field with two levels of parking. While the total capital cost is significantly lower than the permanent field with two levels of parking, there would also be fewer benefits. With only 325 parking spaces, the City would likely not be in a position to grant Samohi exclusive access to the number of spaces required to meet the needs of its faculty and staff, making this option less viable as a partnership with SMMUSD. Furthermore, fewer parking spaces would result in less parking availability for City and Courthouse staff and visitors.  Alternative 2: Temporary Multipurpose Sports Field at the Civic Center with Offsite ParkingAnother alternative for consideration is the development of a temporary multipurpose sports field on the Civic Center site with parking leased offsite at a nearby location to accommodate parking needs of the Civic Center, Courthouse, Civic Auditorium, sports field, and Samohi. Staff would proceed with development of a field at the Civic Center and concurrently undertake a process to identify offsite parking, preferably within walking distance of the Civic Center. This alternative would provide parking for the sports field and could meet the parking needs of the City, Courthouse, Samohi, and the Civic Auditorium and possibly, wholly or partially, address the Coastal Commissions requirements. While this alternative could eliminate the need to build new subterranean parking and thereby save capital costs, the lease costs would need to be negotiated and incurred at least in part by the variety of entities that would utilize the spaces. This option assumes proximate alternative parking sites could be identified within the dynamic development environment and in consideration of future public and private projects near the Civic Center and the Downtown.  Alternative 3: Defer Development of the Multipurpose Sports Field at the Civic Center, Develop a Temporary Multipurpose Sports Field at Memorial Park, and Issue RFP for Civic Auditorium OperatorThe FY 2017-18 CIP Budget includes funding in the amount of $1.35 million for the development of a Master Plan for Memorial Park, which would include both the existing park and the 2.91-acre parcel that currently houses the Colorado Yards (also known as the former Fisher Lumber site). Council could consider directing staff to delay the master planning process and instead proceed with utilizing a portion of the Colorado Yards, combined with reconfiguring some of the existing park facilities and amenities, to design and construct a temporary multipurpose sports field at Memorial Park.  This multipurpose sports field would be used by Samohi and the community instead of developing the Civic Center field at this time (see Exhibit 3 below). Samohi sports teams currently utilize Memorial Parks baseball and softball fields as well as the indoor basketball courts. While this alternative would provide an additional multipurpose field centrally located in the City, it would not be adjacent to Samohi thereby requiring students to continue to travel to Memorial Park for practice and games. Should this alternative be constructed, City staff would commit to assist SMMUSD with identifying safe modes of transportation for students from Samohi to the park, including exploring a possible direct shuttle option. Following the design process and appropriate environmental review, construction of the field at Memorial Park could potentially begin in July 2019 with the field opening in July 2020. The estimated project timeline would be a faster option than building the proposed temporary field at the Civic Center as a field at Memorial Park would not require a comprehensive parking study or an amendment to the CCSP, and would not require a Coastal Development Permit since it would not be in the coastal zone.  Staff would proceed concurrently with issuing an RFP for a field design consultant and an RFP for an operator of the Civic Auditorium, per Councils direction to staff on February 9, 2016 when the Civic Working Groups Final Report was presented to Council (Attachment A). At that time, staff recommended Council focus on the Civic Auditorium by issuing an RFP for an operator and deferring decisions about the rest of the site until other planning processes had been completed and more information was available (e.g. Samohi Campus Plan, Downtown Community Specific Plan, Airport Park Expansion, and the possible exploration of ways to finance sports fields such as through public-private partnerships). Council directed staff to issue an RFP for an operator with the stipulation that proposals must be consistent with the ECLS as designed and the sports field as represented in the 2005 CCSP. The RFP has not been issued, pending information related to the design and ultimate direction of the sports field.     Alternative 4: Defer Development of the Multipurpose Sports Field at the Civic Center and Issue RFP for Civic Auditorium OperatorAs mentioned above, Council previously directed staff to issue an RFP for an operator with the stipulation that proposals must be consistent with the ECLS as designed and the sports field as represented in the 2005 CCSP. A decision to issue the RFP now and defer the field would likely be supported by Civic Auditorium advocates and preservationists, but strongly opposed by the Samohi advocates and broader community that voiced an immediate need for a multipurpose sports field in close proximity to the high school, as well as a need to implement the plan as contemplated in the 2005 CCSP. This alternative would also not address the need for a softball field near Samohi. Commission ActionThe Recreation and Parks Commission considered the temporary and permanent multipurpose Civic Center sports field options at its June 15, 2017 meeting and approved a motion to recommend to Council that it direct staff to move forward with development of the temporary field option. The economic analysis had not been finalized at the time of the meeting and, therefore, the Commissions decision was based upon the timeline and capital cost considerations. The Commission cited concerns with the permanent fields overall capital cost as well as dissatisfaction with the possibility of utilizing a large percentage of a potential future parks bond to finance it.  SummaryThere are opportunities, challenges, and risks associated with each option and alternative considered in this report. Several options and alternatives provide field space in an ideal location but at great financial costs and with significant risks. Considering all factors, the least costly, least risky, and fastest alternative would be to develop a temporary multipurpose sports field at Memorial Park. However, this approach would not meet the desires of the Samohi community who have advocated for a multipurpose sports field with a softball field overlay adjacent to the high school campus. Staff recommends Council consider all costs, risks, and benefits associated with each option and alternative and provide direction to staff on how to proceed. For Councils reference, a summary of options and alternatives is provided in Attachment H. ", "background": "On February 9, 2016 (Attachment A), staff presented the Civic Working Group Final Report and proposed next steps to Council. Council directed staff to explore the possibility of placing a temporary field at the corner of 4th Street and Pico Boulevard, to work with partners such as SMMUSD and Santa Monica College on funding options and to return to Council in May 2016 with cost estimates. At the May 24, 2016 Council budget study session (Attachment B), funding totaling $200,000 was identified in FY 2016-17 as part of the FY 2016-18 Capital Improvement Program (CIP) for design of the field. Following considerable discussion and in response to public testimony, Council adopted a motion directing staff to earmark funds for the construction of the Civic Center multi-purpose sports field as identified in the adopted 2005 Civic Center Specific Plan and to provide quarterly updates to Council on the status of the project to ensure it moves forward as quickly as possible. In addition to the aforementioned $200,000 budgeted in FY 2016-17 for the design of the temporary Civic Center sports field, the five-year CIP budget plan for FY 2016-21 also includes the use of $3.25 million in reserve funds for construction of the Civic Center sports field in FY 2018-19. On October 25, 2016 (Attachment C), staff presented a quarterly update on the project at a Council study session. Following the presentation, Council directed staff to initiate a discussion with Coastal Commission staff regarding the temporary sports field project on the Civic Center parking lot and its resulting removal of approximately 600 spaces of surface parking; continue discussions with SMMUSD staff regarding a potential partnership project in the Civic Center to include subterranean parking and a permanent multi-purpose sports field with associated permanent amenities; and to reissue the Request for Proposals (RFP) to a wider range of potential firms for the design of the temporary field in an effort to identify a fee proposal that was aligned with the $200,000 budget in the FY 2016-17 CIP budget. Staff proceeded per Councils direction and issued an Information Item on January 17, 2017 to provide Council with an interim progress update (Attachment D). Staff returned to Council on February 28, 2017 to deliver an update on discussions with Coastal Commission staff, ongoing negotiations with SMMUSD, and a plan to award the feasibility and concept portion of the design contract to RJM Design Group Inc. (Attachment E). Council directed staff to continue negotiations with SMMUSD regarding the partnership project and set a definitive deadline of June 2017 to either reach an agreement or end negotiations and proceed with advancing the temporary multipurpose sports field without subterranean parking. Council also directed staff to develop a comprehensive plan for the sports field to ensure future needs of the Civic Auditorium were considered and the field would not impede its rehabilitation. ", "summary": "Staff has continued working to advance a multipurpose sports field at the Civic Center per Councils direction, including exploring a potential partnership project with the Santa Monica-Malibu School District (SMMUSD) that would develop a permanent multipurpose sports field with a softball field overlay and two levels of subterranean parking. City and District staff have come to an initial agreement on proposed terms for a joint use parking and field agreement and an economic analysis was conducted to determine what each agencys equitable pro rata financial contribution to the project would be, as well as immediate and long-term financial impacts should the project move forward. Given the financial impacts identified by the economic analysis, staff recommends Council consider several options and alternatives and provide direction accordingly."}, "title": " Civic Center Multipurpose Sports Field Feasibility Study and Economic Analysis Findings and Options for Next Steps", "Sponsors": "Director David Martin, Director Susan Cline, Director Gigi Decavalles-Hughes", "recommendations": ["         Review and comment on feasibility study and economic analysis findings for the temporary and permanent multipurpose sports field with a softball field overlay; and", "         Consider options and alternatives and provide direction to staff on next steps.", ""], "Department": "Community & Cultural Services"}], [{"Category": "09. Public Hearings", "body": {"other": "The proposed two-year budget is balanced, with resources dedicated to maintaining the Citys core services and allocating new and repurposed funding to programs that reflect Council priorities. The Proposed Biennial Budget for the City of Santa Monica has been revised from the document presented to the public on May 16, 2017 to reflect final changes based on Council feedback and new information received. The Proposed Budget as revised is $774.9 million in FY 2017-18 and $802.8 million in FY 2018-19. The May 23 and 24 Budget Study Sessions provided an opportunity for Councilmembers to ensure the Proposed Budget meets community needs. During the study sessions, Councilmembers directed staff to consider incorporating various changes to the proposed operating budget, and to provide additional information on certain items in time for the budget adoption public hearing on June 27, 2017. Requested information is included below and any relevant changes are included in the list of proposed final changes shown in Attachment D. Vision Zero Council directed staff to assign a staff member dedicated to Vision Zero, an initiative seeking to eliminate traffic fatalities and serious injuries. Staff proposes the creation of a two-year action plan that will be presented to Council for review by October 2017. Until then, staff has identified an interim staffing plan for a Vision Zero Coordinator. Staff in the Mobility Division of the Planning and Community Development Department will take on temporary assignments to allow a single coordinator to give interdepartmental leadership to all aspects of pursuing Vision Zero. Rather than spending new dollars on additional staffing at this time, staff recommends that one-time funds of $500,000 be appropriated to the FY 2017-18 Proposed Budget for Vision Zero action plan projects that will occur over the next two years. Projects would include the installation of targeted physical improvements that would be complemented with other education, encouragement and enforcement efforts currently underway. Staff has developed a proposal to expend the funds based on a review of high-collision intersections, the Pedestrian Action Plan demand and crash analysis, community destinations and Council comments, as follows:           Improve the Pico/Stewart crossing improvements with one curb extension and lead pedestrian interval to increase pedestrian visibility and reduce exposure ($100,000)          Improve either the Santa Monica Boulevard/6th Street or Broadway/5th Street intersections with two curb extensions and lead pedestrian interval to increase visibility and reduce pedestrian exposure ($180,000)          Install Rapid Rectangular Flashing Beacons to increase vehicle yielding at two Wilshire intersections and two school locations ($120,000)          Pilot bicycle and pedestrian protections on Arizona Avenue at McKinley Elementary or similar location ($80,000)          Install lead pedestrian intervals at 25 signalized intersections throughout Santa Monica (identified based on pedestrian volumes, crash history and adjacent community destinations) (Staff time cost)         Continue enforcement and education operations (Staff time cost) Additional funds for capital investment in making all of Santa Monica streets safer for all users from the recently passed County Measure M and the additional local return of gas tax funds approved by Governor Brown and the State Legislature. Using Data to Impact Service DeliveryCouncil requested assurances that staff would begin applying the Citys new Framework and performance management model to impact service delivery and budget decision-making. At its January 28, 2017 retreat (Attachment O), Council received staffs report on a new organizational framework based on the dimensions of wellbeing and the Sustainable City Plan that would assist with creating a performance management system.   In response to Councils direction, staff worked to better integrate sustainability and governance into the Wellbeing Framework in preparation for the FY 2017-19 budget.  This refined Framework, presented in the Proposed Budget, is built on the longstanding commitments and goals of the Sustainable City Plan and the baseline findings of the first Wellbeing Index from 2015.  Staff used the Framework to organize budget proposals, prioritize budget requests and ultimately frame the FY 2017‑19 budget around its six outcome areas (community, place and planet, learning, health, economic opportunity and governance).  This fall, the next version of the Wellbeing Index will be released. Over the coming year, findings from the next Index and goals from the Sustainable City Plan will be integrated into the Framework.  This will establish meaningful goals and metrics to track the impact of City work efforts, including Council Strategic Goals.   Staff will engage a range of community partners to address issues of most concern to the community.  This summer there will be staff training on the next steps to launch the Citys new performance management process, SaMoStat, beginning with its application to the Councils Strategic Goals. The first SaMoStat meeting will be held in July, focusing on our regional efforts to reduce homelessness. Reed Park ProgrammingCouncil requested information on options to increase staff presence and activities at the newly-renovated Reed Park in order to maintain a safe, accessible and attractive open space. Staff spoke with Downtown Santa Monica, Inc. regarding extending the Ambassador Program to Reed Park but found it to be cost prohibitive. Siting Ambassadors at Reed Park, which is further from the Downtown core in which the Ambassadors operate, to provide daily hospitality services and restroom monitoring, would cost between $520,000 and $572,000 annually. Therefore, at this time staff is focused on continuing to pursue a site-specific activation strategy of recreational, cultural, and enrichment programs, events, and activities for youth, families, adults, and seniors as well as a communication and outreach campaign.   As one means to increase programming in and activate Reed Park, staff will return to Council during the summer of 2017 with a proposed reduction to the current annual fee structure for fitness instruction, classes and camps operating in Reed Park and recommendations for a pilot program. Commercial fitness or athletic instruction, classes, or camps in City parks and on Santa Monica State Beach are currently subject to a Permit Fee, which was set by Council in 2013 at $100 and subject to annual CPI increases. An additional $50 Permit Fee is added if an RFP, lottery or other allocation process is required to compensate for additional staff time. In addition to the Permit Fee(s), an annual charge for use of the City parks and the Santa Monica State Beach is imposed: $1,800 for small group (not more than 2); $3,600 for medium group (not more than 10); $5,400 for large group (more than 10).  Currently, a 50% reduction in annual charge is applied for groups operating in Reed Park. Modifying the existing requirements further for Reed Park may incentivize use, potentially attracting new fitness instructors not currently under the permit system and/or entice current permitted instructors to re-locate to Reed Park. Homeless Multi-disciplinary Street TeamCouncil noted the need to continue funding the Homeless Multi-disciplinary Street Team (HMST), one of the jump start projects associated with the Addressing Homelessness Strategic Goal, which began operating in September 2016. The team consists of four full-time staff and a part-time psychiatrist through a contract with The People Concern, joined by medical staff from Venice Family Clinic, and provides care on the streets, in parks, jails and hospitals to the highest utilizers of City emergency services (police, fire, hospitals). It is funded through December 2017 with $300,000 in one-time City of Santa Monica funds. Since the May 24, 2017 Budget Study Session, staff has learned that Supervisor Sheila Kuehl has agreed to provide $300,000 in discretionary funds to sustain the program through June 2018 and will consider an additional grant for the same amount for FY 2018-19 operations. City funding of $300,000 is requested to sustain the program through June 2019. The extension of the program would also allow for an assessment of step down interventions post-housing to determine how best to transition participants from HMST to other lower-intensity support services, thereby allowing the team to serve new individuals. Discussions are also underway to engage the business community to support this project as another on-going source of partial funding. Staff is recommending that Council approve the transfer of $300,000 in General Fund jump start funding in FY 2018-19 to extend the program an additional year as a proof of concept project. This extension would result in a strong, multi-year data set upon which to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention. As demonstrated by other evaluative tools such as the Wellbeing Index and the Youth Report Card, demonstrating social impact interventions requires consistent multi-year assessments to measure impact over time. RAND will evaluate the program, looking specifically at the effectiveness of the intervention for this highly vulnerable population and to see if the service model results in fewer contacts with local emergency services.  Social Safety NetCouncil expressed concern that the budget proposed by the Trump Administration could have severe impacts on the members of our community with the greatest need and fewest options. While the federal budget is only a proposal at this point and is expected to undergo significant modification by Congress, the threat is significant. A preliminary review of FY 2016-17 funding sources for the 20 Human Services Grants Program (HSGP) funded agencies indicates that they rely on $21 million in federal funding. This represents approximately 13% of the HSGP-funded agencies budgets. In addition, agencies report a $65 million reliance on other (state and local) government sources, portions of which could originate from federal sources, for an additional 40% of their agencies budgets. Staff is working with local agencies to project direct and indirect impacts of proposed safety net cuts at both the agency and community level. Staff will also coordinate with state and regional entities to avoid duplication of effort and ensure local funds are used to fill local gaps. Among the programs slated for elimination are the Department of Housing and Urban Developments (HUD) Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME programs. $201K of the Citys annual $1.03 million CDBG allocation is granted to the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles (LAFLA) ($80K), Westside Center for Independent Living (WCIL) ($36K), Chrysalis ($40K), and St. Joseph Center ($45K). The Housing Division also uses CDBG for rehabilitation of 20 existing apartments per year where low-income households earning 80% of AMI reside. The HOME Program provides assistance totaling $437,000 to 16 households, and another 10 voucher holders are currently searching for apartments. The average monthly subsidy for all participants is over $15,000. Both of these grants also provide administrative funds to reimburse the City for the costs of administering the programs. HUDs Section 8 program provides a monthly housing subsidy to 995 households that totals over $11 million. An estimated $500,000 decrease in funding is possible with passage of the Trump Administration budget. If the budget is decreased by $500,000, approximately 100 households could lose their housing subsidies. While more research is needed to assess grantee needs, staff estimates that the annual impact of the current budget proposal on the Citys programs could be approximately $1.5 million. Staff will continue to monitor budget negotiations in Congress. Once a final federal budget is adopted, staff will confirm any impacts in Santa Monica, as well as potential options for addressing the local need.  Los Amigos RestroomsCouncil requested an update on progress to improve the area surrounding the Los Amigos restrooms. Staff is working with the contractor for the Los Amigos Cistern Project to remove the infield clay recently installed and replace it with decomposed granite. There was also a hose bib near the problematic location causing ponding that has been removed. The expectation is that these efforts will be sufficient to resolve the pathway issues. However, staff will continue to monitor the situation and if there are still issues at this location, staff will also obtain a cost estimate to install a concrete path. Woodlawn Cemetery Council noted a need for increased maintenance along 17th Street adjacent to Woodlawn Cemetery. There are currently 4 public litter containers on the west side of 17th Street between Delaware and Pico. Two of these containers were added in the past six months. There is room to add two more, one in a cut out area and the other near the fire hydrant. RRR staff will deliver two additional containers for a total of six. Public Landscape renovated plantings along this stretch of 17th Street in March at the request of Councilmember Vazquez. As a part of this project a new irrigation system, plant materials and landscape mulch were installed (see Attachment P). The new plantings are being established and will ultimately fill in the landscaped area. Proposed Budget RevisionsModifications to the Proposed Budget, known as final changes, are based on Council direction, new information and identified omissions. The changes increase the budget by $1.2 million in FY 2017-18 and $0.7 million in FY 2018-19. In FY 2017-18, the changes primarily reflect use of one-time funds to support Vision Zero projects, staffing adjustments, and an adjustment in the Wastewater Fund to reflect updated costs for shared use of the Hyperion Treatment Plant. In FY 2018-19, the changes primarily reflect ongoing costs for adjustments made in FY 2017-18. An additional information-only change will be made to the capital improvement budget to reflect staffs upcoming recommendation that the City issue lease revenue bonds for the construction of Fire Station 1 in FY 2017-18. The change from pay as you go funding to bond funding will take advantage of an optimal bond market. Staff will return to Council to request authorization to issue a bond at an appropriate time. Staff recommends that Council adopt the changes to the FY 2017-18 Proposed Budget, and approve changes to the FY 2018-19 Proposed Budget. With these changes, the budget remains balanced. Changes are itemized in Attachment D. Council Discretionary FundsEach year, Council allocates discretionary funds to assist the community in special projects or support important but otherwise unfunded priorities. Traditionally, Council has supported community partners like the Business Improvement Districts, Santa Monica traditions like the Fourth of July Parade, one-time programs, and community students through science or music grants allowing Santa Monica youth to participate in special events. Allocation of the funds may occur along with Budget Adoption or throughout the year. Including unprogrammed FY 2016-17 discretionary funds and FY 2017-18 discretionary funds, the Council has access to $553,762 in discretionary funds in FY 2017-18. Fees/Fines/RatesDuring the budget study sessions, departments presented adjusted or new fees and rates that were included in the Proposed Budget and recommended in the comprehensive fee study. Staff anticipates that implementation of the fee study recommendations would result in approximately $1.2 million in additional revenue, $0.7 million of which is in the General Fund. As part of the adoption of the FY 2017-19 Budget, staff is presenting three fee/fine/rate related resolutions to Council for adoption. The master fee resolution (Attachment E) contains user fees and rates charged by the City, primarily fees analyzed in the recent fee study as well as new regulatory fees related to the Citys water neutrality ordinance. In addition, a master fine resolution (Attachment F) is being presented that includes all fines assessed by the City in one resolution. This includes administrative citation fines, parking violation fines, library fines, and fines for excessive responses to false alarms by the Police and Fire Departments. Two new non‑standard fines for violations of the Municipal Code related to tenant harassment have been added as well as a new Library fine for overdue teen laptop rentals. Finally, a comprehensive parking rate resolution (Attachment G) includes the recommended changes to beach parking rates presented during the budget study sessions, a pilot program for employees of businesses located in the downtown area, as well as a specific bulk parking fee for the California Judicial Council for one year to allow for the Council to address budget impacts resulting from the City not renewing its parking agreement with the Council in anticipation of the multipurpose sports field. The beach parking rate increase is set to take effect on November 1, 2017. Resolutions related to enterprises or mitigation fees will continue to be separate and will be updated and presented to Council in the future as appropriate.  Personnel ChangesAs part of the budget process, proposed employee classification and compensation changes were reviewed by the Human Resources Department and the City Managers Office.

This restriction was placed in effect in November 1979 with the approval of Proposition 4, commonly known as the (Paul) Gann Initiative.

High original cost is due to the cost to retrofit an unleaded Ford Ranger to an electric Ford Ranger. The unit will no longer hold a charge long enough to transport staff from one location to another and is almost never used. This has negatively affected the efficiency of Park Maintenances day-to-day operations. In addition, Ford and the subcontractor no longer provide repair and part support for this unit.   Example of a Good Earth FireFly Three-Wheeled Electric Utility Vehicle with Dump Body Of the 17 vehicles that would be replaced through this purchase, 14 would be used by 14 Groundskeepers in Park Maintenance to transport staff, equipment, and materials to maintain 9 parks throughout the City as assigned below:1.     Marine Park  1 Groundskeeper2.     Crescent Bay Park & Barnard Linear Park  1 Groundskeeper3.     South Beach Park & Beach Park I  1 Groundskeeper4.     Ocean View Park  1 Groundskeeper5.     Reed Park  1 Groundskeeper6.     Douglas Park  1 Groundskeeper7.     Virginia Ave Park  1 Groundskeeper8.     Memorial Park  1 Groundskeeper9.     Hotchkiss Park & Joslyn Park  1 Groundskeeper10. 5 sections of Palisades Park  5 Groundskeepers The remaining three vehicles would be used in the Downtown district by Promenade Maintenance staff. The vehicles would be used by various maintenance workers and equipment operators and are not assigned to any one individual. The vehicles would be used during two shifts, seven days per week, all year. They would be used to transport staff and equipment to various locations in the downtown area. Tasks performed by staff utilizing these vehicles include emptying trashcans, picking up litter, cleaning amenities in the district, weed abatement, and cleaning trash bin rooms in the parking structures.  This purchase would replace Miles Electric Vehicles with dump beds and one electric Ford Ranger pickup truck with Good Earth FireFly Electric Vehicles with dump beds. The custom-built, modified FireFly with dump bed specifications were developed considering the Citys Sustainable Fleet Administrative Instruction and Sustainability Plan, as well as, the operational requirements of Park Maintenance and Promenade Maintenance.

More waste is created.    Contradicts the Sustainability Plan and the Sustainable Fleet AI.  The Good Earth FireFly Electric Vehicle is able to provide the performance, battery life, and payload necessary to support the Park Maintenance and Promenade Maintenance sections of the Public Landscape Division and adheres to the guidelines set forth in the Citys Sustainable Fleet Administrative Instruction and Sustainability Plan.  The bid specifications included language requesting bids for the Good Earth FireFly, or an equivalent vehicle, giving vendors the option to take exception to or propose an alternative vehicle that meets the minimum requirements in order to meet operational needs. This solicitation was not considered a sole source as there were multiple distributors who could have potentially bid. Furthermore, given electric vehicles, especially for commercial use, are an emerging technology, staff felt it important for vendors to provide vendors the opportunity to propose other vehicle models that met City specifications.  There are many standard features which factor into the overall price of the Good Earth FireFly electric vehicle. The battery technology the Good Earth FireFly vehicles has improved over the last few years, making the vehicles safer, more sustainable and efficient. The FireFly vehicles were also the best fit because of their road-worthiness. Many competing vehicles in this market are also safe up to 25 miles per hour on surface streets. This is important because these vehicles would be housed at the Colorado Yards, would be charged overnight, and then would be driven out to each park location on a daily basis. This requires that the vehicle is street legal and can hold a charge for an extended period of time traveling over diverse terrain. The FireFly is classified as a motorcycle and has the ability to go over 25 miles per hour on surface streets. The fact that FireFly vehicles are certified for surface street use while also satisfying the Citys sustainability requirements as defined by the Sustainable Fleet Administrative Instruction make them the best fit for Santa Monica. This purchase meets the goals of the Citys Reduced-Emissions Fuels Policy by utilizing vehicles powered electricity, which reduces emissions. Vendor SelectionIn January 2017, the City published Notices Inviting Bids to furnish and deliver 13 Good Earth FireFly Electric Vehicles or an equivalent type vehicle, with the option to purchase up to five additional vehicles at the same price, terms, and conditions, in accordance with City specifications. The bid was posted on the Citys on-line bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provisions. A total of 134 City of Santa Monica local vendors and 250 external vendors were notified. There were 15 prospective bidders, and 12 vendors downloaded the bid. One bid was received and publicly opened on February 1, 2017, per Attachment A. Staff conducted additional outreach to vendors who downloaded the bid to see why they did not submit a bid; two no-bid responses were received. One vendor could not meet the design changes in the specifications within the delivery timeframe requirement. Adherence to the delivery requirement is crucial in order to prevent spending more and more money to maintain the existing vehicles. Another vendor stated the bid was being submitted by the national distributor, ev Transportation Services, Inc., directly in its stead. In other words, the regional distributor did not submit a bid, the national distributor took the lead. The average cost of maintenance per year per vehicle is $3,050. It takes approximately one year to go through the formal bid process and award the bid. If staff rejected this bid and went back out to bid, approximately $51,850 in additional maintenance costs would be incurred and we would run the risk that some units would fail beyond repair. Staff recommends ev Transportation Services, Inc. as the best bidder for the purchase and delivery of 17 new and unused Good Earth FireFly Electric Vehicles as required by Fleet Management. The bid was evaluated based on the criteria in SMMC 2.24.072, including price, ability to deliver, quality of product, and compliance with City specifications.

Resource Recovery and Recycling currently employs seven street sweepers, three of which would be replaced by the new vehicles. Street sweeping is necessary to maintain the safety, environment and aesthetics of the streets through the removal of debris. Street sweeping protects the environment by assisting in the removal of metals, pesticides, herbicides, oil, and other pollutants and debris that may impact the storm water system.  Street sweeping clears debris from the street and gutter which may impede motorists, bicyclists, or pedestrians. The City currently sweeps over 26,000 curb miles and collects over 2,000 tons of sweeping debris annually. Example of a CNG truck mounted regenerative air street sweeper Vendor selectionIn January 2016, the City solicited bids for the purchase of two Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Truck Mounted Regenerative Air Street Sweepers. The bid was posted on the Citys on-line bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provisions. A total of 578 vendors were notified and 16 vendors downloaded the bid. A total of 3 bids were received and publicly opened on January 21, 2016 per Attachment A. Bids were evaluated based on the criteria in SMMC 2.24.072, including price, previous experience, ability to deliver, quality of product, and compliance with City specifications. Mar-Co Equipment Company is the second lowest bidder and submitted a competitive bid for a model which the City currently employs. The City utilizes multiple sweepers of this model for which Fleet Maintenance staff have been trained to maintain. Mar-co Equipment Companys proposal was able to best meet the Citys requirements, including the ability to provide the method of dumping required in the specification and the option to include a broom assisted pick-up head.  On March 22, 2016, per Attachment B, City Council awarded Bid No. 4234 to Mar-Co Equipment Company for the purchase and delivery of two CNG Truck Mounted Regenerative Air Street Sweepers. After the bid was awarded, three additional CNG truck mounted regenerative air street sweepers reached the end of their cost-effective useful life. Staff contacted Mar-Co Equipment Company and they agreed to provide three additional vehicles at the same price, terms, and conditions as stated in Bid No. 4234, per Attachment C. Staff recommends that City Council authorize the Purchasing Services Manager to piggyback on Bid No. 4234 and issue a purchase order with Mar-Co Equipment Company for three CNG Truck Mounted Regenerative Air Street Sweepers in an amount not to exceed $956,389.

This independently owned and operated restaurant would occupy the vacant the 2nd Street fronting ground floor space (Space B) of approximately 3,306 square feet. An additional outdoor dining area of 306 square feet is also requested. The proposed dining area totals 102 seats including 92 indoor seats, a private dining area, 12 bar seats (counted with indoor seats), and 10 outdoor seats, as depicted in the floor plan shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Proposed Floor Plan The outdoor dining area extends approximately 6 from the building faade within the subject site, adjacent to a 10 public sidewalk along 2nd Street. Dining Area/ Private Dining1,958 sf80 seatsKitchen/Service Area887sfN/ABar Area155 sf12Outdoor Patio306 sfas conditioned10 seats The restaurant would function as a full-service restaurant for sit-down breakfast, lunch and dinner meal service and provide patrons the opportunity to purchase and consume alcoholic beverages Sunday through Saturday - 7 A.M. to 2 A.M. The applicants rationale for the extended hours request is their wish to have consistent hours of alcohol and food service.  Vehicular Parking & CirculationVehicular and pedestrian access to the restaurant is via 2nd Street. However, parking at the Shore Hotel is accessed from Ocean Avenue, a block west of the site, for which there is valet parking 24 hours/7 days a week. The Shore Hotel currently provides 210 standard and compact parking spaces and 70 additional non-required tandem spaces on-site within 4 subterranean parking levels. All of the parking on-site is valet-operated 24-hours daily. With the addition of the proposed restaurant, the required parking for all uses on the site is 223 spaces, resulting in a short fall of 13 spaces. However, with the valet operation in place, the tandem spaces may be utilized to support the restaurants off-street parking requirement. As provided in Condition #10 of the proposed Statement of Official Action, valet parking shall be provided to restaurant patrons during all hours of restaurant operations.  Hotel Entitlements and Limited Amenity Conditions of ApprovalThe City Councils approval of the Shore Hotel development requires the hotel to operate as a limited amenity facility per Condition #10 of DR 05-007, CUP 05-009 and VAR 06-018. As specified in the project conditions of approval, the hotel operator may provide an exercise room, breakfast/meeting room, swimming and spa pools. Additionally, a hotel restaurant/bar, conference facilities, spa, florist, lounge or similar amenities typically found in more luxury hotels may be determined by the Director of Planning to constitute hotel amenities resulting in a change in character that would be subject to Planning Commission approval. However, this condition does not apply to the two restaurant spaces (Spaces A and B) that were planned with the hotels property fronting on 2nd Street and Ocean Avenue if these venues are operated as separate and distinct entities from the hotel and the hotel operations. Space A is currently occupied by Blue Plate Taco and has an approved alcohol CUP with conditions that it be operated separate and distinct from hotel operations. As stated in Condition #3 of the proposed Statement of Official Action, the hours of operation for the full-service restaurant in Space B would be 7:00 a.m.  2:00 a.m. seven days a week with complete closure by 3 a.m. As detailed in the Planning Commission staff report, a number of restaurants have recently been approved with similar hours Downtown and therefore, the hours are appropriate due to lack of nearby residents living within the area. Conditions # 1-10 in the proposed Statement of Official Action are intended to reduce the potential adverse impacts on the surrounding area and ensure that the restaurant operates independently of the hotel and include the following:         102 seats (92 indoor 12 of which may be located along a bar counter) and 10 outdoor seats.         Alcoholic beverages orders shall cease 30 minutes prior to restaurant closure, or no later than the closing of the associated food service of the establishment, whichever is first.          No restaurant delivery to the hotel guestrooms shall occur unless delivery is offered as part of the restaurants typical operations.         No service orders to the restaurant shall be processed through the hotel.         No restaurant charges shall be included on the hotel bill.         The operation of the restaurant shall be separate and distinct from the operation of the Shore Hotel. The approval of Conditional Use Permit 16ENT-0218 (CUP) is applicable solely to Full of Flavor, LLC, and is not applicable to the owners of the Shore Hotel or any of their successors in interest.   Therefore, the CUP shall terminate automatically upon the termination of the operation of the restaurant by Full of Flavor, LLC, unless a proposed successor operator and/or tenant is approved in writing by the Planning Director prior to the commencement of any new operation or tenancy at 1530 2nd Street that requires a Type 47 alcohol license.  In furtherance of achieving the objectives of this condition, the Planning Director may withhold approval until such time as the successor operator and/or tenant provides documentation to substantiate (i) that it is legally separate and distinct from the owners of the Shore Hotel and (ii) that its operation at 1530 2nd Street will be separate and distinct from the Shore Hotel.          Pursuant to SMMC Section 9.41.080(B), after the proposed restaurant has been operational for one (1) year, and then again after seven (7) years of operation if there has been residential development within 500 feet of the site, the applicant shall provide to the City a report summarizing the restaurants compliance with these conditions of approval. After submittal of the compliance report, if staff determines that there have violations of these conditions of approval, staff shall submit the compliance report to the Planning Commission as an information item to enable the Planning Commission to determine whether a public hearing is necessary. Upon review of the compliant report at this public hearing, the Planning Commission may add or revise terms and conditions to the extent necessary to ensure effective conditions of approval.         Valet parking shall be provided to restaurant patrons during all hours of restaurant operations.  Neighborhood CompatibilitySanta Monicas Downtown functions as the Citys greatest concentration of commerce, retail, dining, transit, and entertainment. The C3 District is within the downtown and is intended to maintain and enhance the downtown area. The neighborhood provides a variety of commercial, residential, cultural, and recreational opportunities and complementary uses that generate activity during both daytime and evening hours. The surrounding developments on 2nd Street include a variety of uses, including Santa Monica Place, a newly renovated Parking Structure #6 with expanded ground floor pedestrian uses, Hotel Carmel, retail, and dining. The proposed ground floor restaurant of the Shore Hotel fronts 2nd Street, and since the hotels opening, the space has remained a shell space that has occasionally been used for seminars and events. The proposed restaurant use will enliven 2nd Street by offering a full-service dining option with alcohol service.  The impacts associated with this type of use are generally associated with noise and circulation issues. The proposed valet condition will address the patrons ability to park near the site and the outdoor dining area is minimal with only a small area outside the building on private property available for outdoor dining. It is not anticipated that the alcohol service will be inconsistent with other alcohol service establishments within the downtown, or that the use would negatively impact residential uses that may be near the proposed restaurant.  General Plan ConsistencyThe proposed use is consistent with Goal and Policies established in the Land Use and Circulation Element (LUCE). The subject site is located within the Downtown Core Land Use District, which serves as the Citys center of transportation, commerce, and entertainment. LUCE Goal D1 envisions the Downtown Core as a premier shopping, dining and entertainment destination for local and regional visitors. Policy D1.1 supports the creation of diverse local and regional serving retail and dining opportunities in the district. The subject CUP, as conditioned, would allow a new dining establishment an opportunity to function in a manner that is consistent with other dining facilities and alcohol outlets in the Downtown. LUCE Goal D7 supports the districts balanced mix of uses that reinforce the greatest concentration of activity in the City and Policy D7.1 encourages a broad mix of uses that create dynamic activity in both the daytime and evening hours. The full-service restaurant with incidental alcohol service will provide meal service to residents and visitors during day and evening hours.  Appeal SummaryOn February 14, 2017, the appellant, UNITE HERE Local 11, filed an appeal of the Planning Commissions approval of Conditional Use Permit 16ENT-0128. The full text of the appeal is presented in Attachment C of this report. The appellants appeal statement is summarized below.  1.     The restaurant could impact price and accessibility of the hotel to working people and is not consistent with a limited amenity hotel.  2.     There are unresolved accusations against the hotel owner regarding violation of existing Conditional Use Permits. 3.     There is pending litigation between the Shore Hotel and the Coastal Commission which should be resolved prior to approving a CUP for Space B. 4.     CUP Finding #3 cannot assert that the proposed restaurant tenancy and alcohol service will operate as a standalone operation separate and distinct from the hotel.  5.     CUP Finding #4, that the proposed use is compatible with any of the land uses presently on the subject parcel if the present land uses are to remain cannot be made because the pending Shore Hotel and Coastal Commission litigation puts doubt on the continued operation of the hotel.  6.     CUP Conditions of Approval #2-4, #5, #8 and #9 specifying extended hours of operation, additional seats, delivery service by the restaurant if such service is included in their operations, termination of successor operators under certain conditions and subsequent compliance hearings are moot due to the pending litigation and the inconsistency of the Shore Hotel to operate under the current hotel conditions of approval.  Appeal AnalysisOrdinance No. 2522 (CCS) requires that the provisions of the 1988 Zoning Ordinance, as amended, apply to the properties located in the Downtown Community Plan area until such time as the Plan is adopted and becomes effective. The Council, in its de novo review of this appeal, must determine whether the proposed project meets the following findings for a Conditional Use Permit pursuant to SMMC Section 9.04.20.12.040:(a)  The proposed use is one conditionally permitted within the subject district and complies with all of the applicable provisions of the \"City of Santa Monica Comprehensive Land Use and Zoning Ordinance\".(b)  The proposed use would not impair the integrity and character of the district in which it is to be established or located.(c)   The subject parcel is physically suitable for the type of land use being proposed.(d)  The proposed use is compatible with any of the land uses presently on the subject parcel if the present land uses are to remain.(e)  The proposed use would be compatible with existing and permissible land uses within the district and the general area in which the proposed use is to be located.(f)     There are adequate provisions for water, sanitation, and public utilities and services to ensure that the proposed use would not be detrimental to public health and safety.(g)  Public access to the proposed use shall be adequate.(h)  The physical location or placement of the use on the site is compatible with and relates harmoniously to the surrounding neighborhood.(i)     The proposed use is consistent with the goals, objectives, and policies of the General Plan.(j)     The proposed use would not be detrimental to the public interest, health, safety, convenience, or general welfare.(k)   The proposed use conforms precisely to the applicable performance standards contained in Subchapter 9.04.12, Section 9.04.12.010 and special conditions outlined in Subchapter 9.04.14, Section 9.04.14.010.(l)     The proposed use will not result in an over concentration of such uses in the immediate vicinity,  Council must also make the following additional Alcohol Outlet findings for the dispensing of alcoholic beverages pursuant to SMMC Section 9.04.10.18.030:(a)  The proposed use will not adversely affect the welfare of neighborhood residents in a significant manner.(b)  The proposed use will not contribute to an undue concentration of alcohol outlets in the area.(c)   The proposed use will not detrimentally affect nearby neighborhoods considering the distance of the alcohol outlet to residential buildings, churches, schools, hospitals, playgrounds, park, and other existing alcohol outlets.(d)  The proposed use is compatible with existing and potential uses within the general area.(e)  Traffic and parking congestion will not result.(f)     The public health, safety, and general welfare are protected.(g)  No harm to adjacent properties will result.(h)  The objectives of the General Plan are secured. The Council may uphold the decision of the Planning Commission or grant the appeal, in whole or in part, based upon these findings.  1.     The appellants first point is to assert that the restaurant could impact the price and accessibility of the hotel to working people as a limited amenity to the hotel. The restaurant is being operated by a separate and distinct entity from the hotel and is not permitted to be a hotel amenity. Further, the CUP is only being requested for alcohol service in conjunction with restaurant operations. Condition #8 requires the separation of hotel and restaurant operations and therefore, the proposed restaurant is no more an amenity of the hotel than any other nearby restaurant.  2.     The appellants second point states that the Shore Hotel has outstanding violations with respect to their existing Conditional Use Permits. Notwithstanding that the Shore Hotel and the applicants request for an alcohol CUP in Space B are unrelated, the Code Compliance Division has previously investigated the Shore Hotels possible violations of existing CUPs and determined that the hotel is in compliance. The applicant making the request for the proposed alcohol CUP for Space B is not associated with the ownership of the Shore Hotel. Further the restaurant is being operated separate and distinct from hotel operations.  3.     The appellants third point states that pending litigation between the Shore Hotel and the Coastal Commission should be resolved prior to approving a CUP for Space B. City staff contacted Coastal Commission representatives staff regarding the pending litigation and was informed that the pending litigation should not impact the CUP for  alcohol service by a third party applicant in Space B. Staff was also informed that the trail trial is currently scheduled for June, 2017.  As previously mentioned, the applicant requesting the alcohol CUP for Space B is not an affiliate to the Shore Hotel ownership. The restaurant in Space B is being operated separately from the hotel and would be required to obtain separate approvals from the Coastal Commission prior to commencing operations. 4.     The appellants fourth point contends that CUP Finding #3 (parcel is physically suitable for the proposed use) cannot be met because the hotel and restaurant will not operate as separate entities. This particular finding addresses the physical suitability of the parcel for the proposed use. The tenant space where the restaurant with alcohol service is proposed is on the ground floor of the hotel building with frontage on 2nd Street. The tenant space has a pedestrian entrance on 2nd Street and is suitable for accommodating the proposed restaurant use with alcohol service. The appellants contention that the hotel and restaurant will not operate as separate entities cannot be substantiated. The City has received no evidence that the restaurant will operate as anything but a separate tenant of the hotel. In addition, as noted above, conditions of approval have been included to ensure that the hotel and restaurant operate as separate entities. 5.     The appellants fifth point contends that CUP Finding #4 (compatibility with on-site uses) cannot be met because the hotel is in litigation with the Coastal Commission over its Coastal Development Permit and is unsure if the hotel will continue to operate. As noted in the response to the appellants third point of appeal, City staff contacted Coastal Commission representatives regarding the subject application for a CUP for alcohol service in Space B and was informed that the pending litigation would not preclude the approval of a CUP for the proposed restaurant in Space B by a third party applicant. As previously mentioned, the applicant requesting the alcohol CUP for Space B is unrelated to the operation or ownership of the Shore Hotel. Furthermore, the issuance of the CUP would not alter the respective positions of the Coastal Commission or the Shore Hotel in the pending litigation. Even if the litigation were to result in a termination of hotel operations, such termination would remain a private matter as between the Shore Hotel (as landlord) and the CUP applicant (as tenant). Furthermore, the restaurant in Space B is being operated separately from the hotel and would be required to obtain separate approvals from the Coastal Commission prior to commencing operations. 6.     The appellants sixth point states that Conditions #2 and #3 allow for more seats and extended hours of alcohol service than the previously approved CUP for the subject space (Space B) and those hours for Blue Plate Taco (Space A). The request for a CUP for alcohol service in Space B is a new application that does not rely on previous approvals. In recommending the hours of alcohol service, staff reviewed the approved alcohol service hours for other Downtown restaurants in addition to assessing proximity of residential land uses that could be impacted by alcohol service at the restaurant. Based on the primarily commercial land uses in the immediate surroundings and recently approved alcohol service hours, the 7AM-2AM limitation was approved by the Planning Commission. 7.     The appellants seventh point states that Condition #5 provides a loophole for room service by the hotel. This condition permits the restaurant to deliver food to go to the rooms as they may to any other off-site location and is not related to amenities offered by the hotel. 8.      The appellants eighth point states that Condition #8 does little to prevent the restaurant as a hotel amenity. This condition requires that the hotel and restaurant must operate separately by expressly stating that the CUP terminates with termination of the restaurants operations by the applicant or any approved successors. Any successor operator of the restaurant must provide the Director of Planning evidence to substantiate (i) that it is legally separate and distinct from the owners of the Shore Hotel and (ii) that its operation at 1530 2nd Street will be separate and distinct from the Shore Hotel. 9.     The appellants ninth point states that Condition #9, which requires a compliance report on the restaurants conformance with the CUP conditions, will not lead to successful enforcement given the prior allegations of CUP violations by the hotel. Condition #9 only addresses the restaurants compliance with the alcohol CUP conditions of approval and does not involve the hotel operator at all. Compliance with the alcohol CUP conditions of approval is the responsibility of the restaurant operator. Applicants StatementThe applicant has provided, as requested by the City Attorney, legal documentation to demonstrate their operation as a separate and distinct entity from the Shore Hotel ownership. Additionally, Full of Flavor LLC asserts the dispute between UNITE HERE Local 11 and the Shore Hotel is unfairly impacting their proposed business. They cite the following incidents to demonstrate their findings:           Members of the public acknowledged the proposed restaurant operator is a third party entity during the public testimony.         The proposed CUP conditions are consistent with Blue Plate Taco (restaurant Space A) that require the restaurant serving alcohol operate independently from Shore Hotel ownership;         Unite Here Local 11 makes references to the Shore Hotel (ownership) as being in litigation. The applicant is not part of the litigation and appellant is seeking to combine the validity of the Hotels coastal permit with the pending CUP application. The applicant is in agreement with the proposed conditions of approval including number of seats, hours of operation, delivery service, potential cessation of the CUP upon a change of ownership and possible compliance hearings before the Planning Commission if residential development occurs within 500 feet of the site.  The applicant supplied two letters of project support via the DTSM Downtown Santa Monica Inc. and the Downtown Neighborhood Association prior to the February 1, 2017 hearing. Correspondence was received from the public between the Planning Commissions January 18, 2017 public hearing and the February 1, 2017 meeting supporting UNITE HERE Local 11s arguments for denying the alcohol CUP. The correspondence also alleged bad faith operations of the Shore Hotel with respect to their organization, consistency of the Hotels approved operational conditions and the relationship with UNITE HERE Local 11 and the hotels employees.  This request is exempt from the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), pursuant to Section 15301 (Class 13  Existing Facilities), of the State Implementation Guidelines as the project involves interior improvements to an existing building to establish a new restaurant with on-site sale of beer, wine and distilled spirits.   As an alternative to the staff recommendation, the Council may consider the following with respect to the pending appeal if supported by the full evidentiary record: 1. Approve the appeal (17ENT-0016) submitted by the appellant and deny Conditional Use Permit (16ENT-0128).2. Articulate revised findings and/or conditions to Approve OR Deny the subject appeal. There is no immediate financial impact or budget action necessary as a result of the recommended action.", "background": "The following is a summary of prior permits that have been issued for the subject property:DR 05-007, CUP 05-009, GPA 06-001 and VAR 06-018 (approved March 19, 2008)Development  Review Permit, Conditional Use Permit, General Plan Amendment and Variance was approved by the Planning Commission for the new Shore Hotel.  APP08-006; APP08-007 (approved September 23, 2008)  The Planning Commissions approval of the Development Review Permit, Conditional Use Permit, and Variance for the Shore Hotel was appealed. On September 23, 2008, the City Council denied the appeal and approved the DR, CUP, and Variance for the Shore Hotel with modified conditions. Conditions of approval for the project limited proposed amenities to a 370 square foot exercise room, a 750 square foot meeting room/breakfast room, swimming pool and spa pools and prohibited a restaurant, bar, conferencing facilities, spa, florist, lounge or similar amenities typically found in more upscale or luxury hotels. The separate commercial spaces along Ocean Avenue and 2nd Street are exempt and not subject to these restrictions.  11CUP003; 11CUP004; 11CUP005 (approved August 10, 2011) The owner of the Shore Hotel requested and received three separate Conditional Use Permits for alcohol service within the project site. 11CUP003 was approved in anticipation of a proposed restaurant at 1530 2nd Street Space B (the subject space); 11CUP004 was approved for alcohol sales within the hotels guest rooms (mini-bars) and on-site hotel bar; and 11CUP005 was approved for the restaurant on Ocean Avenue currently operated by Blue Plate Taco (Space A) with specific operational conditions, which were complementary to the hotels conditions to be a limited-amenity hotel. Specific operational conditions associated with the Space A and B alcohol conditional use permits were included to more clearly define the separation of the Hotel from the two independently owned on-site restaurants. These conditions of approval included the following:          No restaurant delivery to the hotel guestrooms shall occur unless delivery is offered as part of the restaurants typical operations.         No food orders to the restaurant shall be processed through the hotel.         No restaurant charges shall be included on the hotel bill.         The operation of the restaurant must be separate and distinct from the operation of the hotel. Further, the Planning Commission approval of 11CUP003 (the subject space) authorized seating arrangements for 74 sit-down patrons plus two (2) waiting area seats and hours of alcohol service:         Sunday through Wednesday - 10:00 AM to 1:00 AM (interior dining area) and 10:00 AM to 12:00 Midnight (outdoor dining area);         Thursday through Saturday - 10:00 AM to 2:00 AM (interior dining area) and 10:00 AM to 1:00 AM (outdoor dining area). However, Conditional Use Permit 11CUP003 expired because operations did not commence.  14PSP008 (approved February 2, 2015) A Performance Standards Permit granting a small, satellite automobile rental agency was approved within the Shore Hotel. The use continues to operate at two small counters totaling 280 square feet within the hotel.  Planning Commission ActionThe Planning Commission initially heard the application request on January 18, 2017 and voted to continue the item to February 1, 2017 to enable the applicant time to meet with Downtown Santa Monica, Inc. and the Downtown Neighborhood Association. On February 1, 2017, the Planning Commission voted 4-2 (one absent) to approve Conditional Use Permit 16ENT-0128. The approval included conditions and modifications to the applicants request and staffs recommended conditions. In the Commissions deliberations, there was a significant amount of discussion regarding the restaurants independent ownership and use from the Hotel, the need for a vibrant pedestrian oriented use within the unfinished space, and discussion of potential impacts related to the Shore Hotels conditions of approval as a limited amenity hotel. In addition to conditions that ensured the separation of the restaurant from the hotel, typical operational conditions, and limitations on hours of alcohol service, the Commission added that if the restaurant were to go out of business, the Conditional Use Permit (CUP) would only transfer to a new restaurant if the successor operator demonstrated that it is legally separate and distinct from the hotel operator and that the operation will be separate and distinct from the hotel. The Commission also required that there be a report summarizing the restaurants compliance with conditions of approval after one year and again after seven years of operation if residential development occurred within 500 feet of the site.  ", "summary": "On August 16, 2016 the applicant, Full of Flavor LLC, filed a Conditional Use Permit application to establish a full service restaurant with alcohol service on the property at 1530 2nd Street. On February 1, 2017, the Planning Commission approved a Conditional Use Permit (16ENT-0128) to allow a Type-47 alcohol license in conjunction with the full service restaurant, subject to conditions of approval in the Statement of Official Action. The appellant, UNITE HERE Local 11, filed a timely appeal on February 14, 2017 (17ENT-0016) of the Planning Commissions approval of Conditional Use Permit 16ENT-0128. The appellant requests that City Council overturn the Planning Commissions approval of the Conditional Use Permit (CUP), stating that the findings cannot be made or justified, the conditions of approval are not adequate and that the use is inconsistent with the CUP conditions of approval placed upon the Shore Hotel (property owner) as a limited amenity hotel. Lastly, the appellant noted that since the Shore Hotel is currently in litigation with the Coastal Commission regarding their Coastal Development Permit, it is not appropriate to approve a restaurant use with alcohol service because it benefits the property owner. Pursuant to the Citys Downtown Interim Ordinance (IZO) No. 2522 (CCS), which established interim procedures and regulations for Downtown pending completion of the Downtown Community Plan, this project is being reviewed for compliance with the 1988 zoning ordinance.

Staff recommends the definition of Lobbyist in Section 4.85.010 be modified as follows: Lobbyist means any individual who receives economic consideration as the employee, representative, or contractor of a person or entity other than the City of Santa Monica for the purpose of influencing a legislative or administrative City actions. For the purpose of this Chapter, Lobbyist does not include City contractors or those seeking City contracts through bids and proposals.  Clarify the definition of Official  Staff recommends modifying the definition of Official as follows: Official means any person who is:(a)  Elected to the City Council;(b) Appointed by the City Council to serve on a board or commission or as a City employee Planning Commissioner, Architectural Review Board Member, Landmarks Commissioner, Personnel Board Member, City Manager, City Attorney, City Clerk;(c)  A City employee appointed to serve as a director of a City department; (d) A City employee who makes direct recommends to a person listed in subsection (a), (b) or (c) or who has decision-making authority as to contracts, permits or other governmental approvals or benefits. Any City employee who is required to file a Statement of Economic Interest.  Clarify registration and reporting requirements.Section 4.85.020 outlines the registration and reporting requirements. Based on current practices, staff recommends amending the information required on the registration form. Additionally, this section could distinguish what constitutes an amendment or addendum. Since increased transparency is a goal of the lobbyist regulations, staff distinguished between an amendment and an addendum. An amendment would be required to be filed when a new client is represented by the lobbyist. An addendum allows the lobbyist to update its existing registration such as to indicate new contacts with City officials on behalf of existing clients. Finally, staff recommends adding a section regarding exemptions to the registration and reporting requirements to reflect Councils direction exempting lobbying at public meetings and current practices implemented based on discussions with local lobbyists and community groups. Staff recommends the following:Section 4.85.020 - Registration and reporting requirements.A.

The new below ground holding tank is sized to provide peak daily irrigation needs to the park during dry summer months. A newly designed above ground pump station skid system would supply treated urban runoff to the existing irrigation system. Marine Park uses approximately 3.5 million gallons, equivalent to four Olympic sized swimming pools of potable water, each year, with nearly all of the usage to irrigation. From recent estimation the project would supply the entire 3.5 million gallons/year of water usage for irrigation via treated urban water runoff from the Penmar Project, resulting in potable water savings. The Marine Park Irrigation Retrofit Project is included in the City of Santa Monicas Measure V 5-year Capital Improvement Plan and is consistent with the type of projects identified by the Santa Monica Bay Beaches Bacterial TMDL Implementation Plan. Rather than using the estimated annual 3.5 million gallons of potable water, this project effectively functions as a water saving measure by using treated non-potable water to irrigate landscape. This project is unique because of the joint usage between Santa Monica and Los Angeles cities for the treatment and reuse of non-potable water. Construction is anticipated to begin in April 2017 and be completed by December 2017.  Contractor Selection - ConstructionOn November 10, 2016, the City published Notices Inviting Bids for construction services for the Marine Park Irrigation Retrofit Project. The bid was posted on the Citys online bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provisions.  A total of 1982 vendors were notified and 63 vendors downloaded the bid. Five bids were received and publicly opened on December 12, 2016.

The City Attorney reviewed the applicable provisions in Public Contract Code Section 5103, and based on that review advised staff to return the bid bond submitted by Blois Construction Inc. The contractors estimate and bid breakdowns were reviewed in detail for validation. It was found that the original contractors estimate did not include the correct quantity calculations for the paving operations on the project. After spending considerable time and effort to determine if the contractor could overcome these omissions, the contractor concluded that the substantially reduced price would not allow them to provide the quality needed on this project forcing them to withdraw its bid.  Bids were evaluated based on criteria in SMMC 2.24.072, including pricing, understanding of the project scope, direct experience with similar projects, approach to the work, technical competence, qualifications of the proposed staff, and the ability to meet the project schedule. Staff contacted reference agencies listed by the recommended contractor to ascertain past performance on similar projects, including City of Lomita, City of La Habra, City of Fontana, and City of Moreno Valley. Staff also verified with the Contractors State License Board that Sully-Miller Contracting Co. and its subcontractors licenses are current, active, and in good standing. Based on these criteria, Sully-Miller Contracting Co., is recommended as the best bidder for construction services of the Marine Park Irrigation Retrofit.  Consultant Selection - Construction ManagementOn September 22, 2015, the City issued a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for construction management and inspection services for upcoming construction projects on the Citys online bidding website. A total of 1674 venders were notified and 124 vendors downloaded the RFQ. The City received 25 proposals. Responses to the RFQ were reviewed by a selection panel of staff from the Public Works Department. Evaluation was based on the selection criteria set forth in SMMC Section 2.24.073, with specific review of the following: technical competence, staffing capability, project approach, past performance, dispute resolution, quality control, cost control, management services, customer service, and the ability to meet required time frames. The top four firms (Anderson-Penna, Arcadis, CWE, and GK Associates) were invited to participate in the Request for Proposal (RFP) phase in June 2016. Based on the selection criteria set forth in SMMC 2.24.073, Arcadis US, Inc. is recommended as the best qualified firm to provide construction management and inspection services based on its qualifications and its directly related experience providing similar services for municipal agencies.  Arcadis US, Inc. has extensive knowledge and experience on numerous construction projects in the cities of Los Angeles, Coachella, Highland, South Pasadena, Santa Monica, and Irvine. Services provided by Arcadis US, Inc. would include construction management services, continuous inspection of the contractors work, verification and management of field changes and unforeseen conditions, monitoring and mitigation of impacts as a result of the construction activities, attendance at the construction contractors safety meetings, attendance at periodic progress meetings, recordkeeping of all necessary inspection documentation relevant to the work performed during construction, and public outreach.  Public OutreachPublic outreach during construction of this Project would be provided by the City and by the Citys construction management consultant as part of the construction management effort. Public outreach would include notifications distributed to adjacent properties and the surrounding community regarding the scope of the Project, and schedule periodic updates on the Citys Know Before You Go (aka KBUG) website and Monday editions of the Santa Monica Daily Press. Notifications would also be posted on social media and in local newspapers. Properties impacted by the Project would receive two construction notices. The first general notice would be hand delivered to properties adjacent to the proposed Project two weeks prior to the start of construction. A second two-day notice would be subsequently hand-delivered to each adjacent property with detailed information regarding the planned construction activity, potential impacts, and contact information.  The notices would be prepared by Public Works staff and distributed by the construction management consultant.  A project specific outreach campaign, including one-on-one coordination with: 1) City of Los Angeles Penmar Park/Golf Course, 2) Marine Park and 3) Growing Place day care at the Marine Park Campus would commence prior to start of construction and continue through completion of the Project. Street Parking along Dewey StreetThe new treated urban runoff pipe alignment would be just south of the centerline of Dewey Street.  Currently, parking is on the north side of Dewey Street only. During construction, some parking on the north side would be impacted, however, residents would continue to have unimpeded access to their properties, and after each working day, all impacted parking would be restored.Environmental ExemptionIn 2012, a Notice of CEQA Exemption was submitted and subsequently approved by the State Clearinghouse with a Categorical Exemption per State Guide section 15301(b) and 15061(b)(3) (Attachment D). Section 15301(b) allows for minor alterations to existing publicly-owned structures, including utilities. Section 15061(b) (3) states that provisions of CEQA only apply to those projects which have the potential to cause a significant adverse environmental impact. The City determined that the proposed project will not have a significant adverse impact on the environment, therefore, this project is exempt from CEQA requirements. ", "background": "Currently, the Citys groundwater treatment facilities supply up to 75 percent of the Citys water needs while the other 25 percent of the water demand is outsourced through the Metropolitan Water District (MWD). The Marine Park Project is funded by the Clean Beaches and Ocean Parcel Tax (Measure V) and Proposition 84 through the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), and is considered an Integrated Regional Water Management (IRWM) Project which improves water reliability, protects and improves water quality, and improves local water security by reducing dependence on imported water. The Proposition 84 grant is funding approximately forty percent of the project.  The Los Angeles County Flood Control District and the DWR have entered into a grant agreement to provide funding assistance to public agencies in Los Angeles County to implement various IRWM projects, including the City of Santa Monicas Marine Park project and the City of Los Angeles Penmar Water Quality Improvement and Runoff Reuse Project (Penmar Project). The Penmar Project consists of two phases. Phase I is complete and diverts urban runoff from the cities of Santa Monica and Los Angeles into a 2.75-million-gallon reservoir (runoff capture facility) that was constructed beneath Penmar Park in the City of Los Angeles. Phase II of the Penmar project is currently in construction and consists of installing the systems required to treat the captured stormwater and distribute it to three primary stakeholders. Treated storm water would be used to irrigate Penmar Golf Course (City of Los Angeles), Penmar Park (City of Los Angeles), and Marine Park (City of Santa Monica). Phase II includes the installation of an urban runoff treatment system, as well as other required infrastructure and components that will integrate the treatment system into the existing irrigation treatment systems at the three locations.  Memorandum of AgreementPursuant to the terms of the Grant Agreement, the City of Santa Monica and City of Los Angeles are required to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for purposes of supplying TUR from the City of Los Angeles runoff capture facility to the City of Santa Monicas Marine Park. The primary terms of the agreement include: yearly term of the agreement, project implementation roles, project operation and maintenance, cost for TUR use, available supply of TUR, and pump operation for the distribution of TUR. Currently, the MOA is under review at the City of Los Angeles. The City of Los Angeles estimates the MOA will be executed by March 9, 2017. Awarding the construction contract, and subsequently commencing construction, prior to MOA execution places the City at risk of building the planned facilities without a guaranteed supply of TUR or a legally binding TUR rate. However, deferring the construction award, and construction, until after MOA execution, places the City at risk of missing the Prop 84 grant project completion deadline of December 31, 2017. In order to help alleviate the prior risk, the City of Los Angeles provided the City of Santa Monica with a Letter of Intent (LOI) (Attachment C) detailing the agreed upon terms of $2.85 per hundred cubic feet that the City of Santa Monica would have to pay for receiving the treated water from the Penmar Project. This equates to 80 percent of the Citys potable water rates.  Labor Compliance ProgramProposition 84 (Safe Drinking Water, Water Quality and Supply, Flood Control, River and Coastal Protection Bond Act of 2006) requires that awarding bodies have an approved Labor Compliance Program (LCP).  LCPs are entities which are approved by the Director of Industrial Relations to monitor and enforce compliance with state prevailing wage laws on public works projects.  An LCP is required to inform contractors about their prevailing wage obligations, monitor compliance by obtaining and reviewing certified payrolls reports, investigating complaints and other suspected violations and take appropriate enforcement action when violations are found.  In order to receive Proposition 84 grant funds, the City has to have an approved LCP enforcement manual.  To assist with prevailing wage compliance, the City has contracted with Gafcon to serve as the labor compliance consultant under this Labor Compliance Program. A resolution must be adopted by City Council prior to the City submitting its LCP application to the State (Attachment A). As part of its scope of work, Gafcon drafted a LCP Manual (Attachment B), which documents the Citys implementation of its proposed LCP. If approved by Council, the LCP Manual will need to be reviewed by the State Department of Industrial Relations as part of its approval of the Citys proposed LCP.  ", "summary": "In accordance with the Sustainable City plan, the City of Santa Monica has a 100 percent water supply self-sufficiency goal by the year 2020 in which a major component of the plan includes reduction in overall water demand. The Marine Park Irrigation Retrofit Project (Project) would assist in achieving that goal by reducing overall water demand through usage of alternative water supply methods for irrigation needs at Marine Park. The project aims to conserve nearly 3.5 million gallons of potable water per year which would assist the City in reaching the overall water supply self-sufficiency goal through water conservation. The Marine Park Irrigation Retrofit Project (Project) includes the installation of approximately 5,000 linear feet of treated urban runoff (TUR) water pipeline from a 2.75-million-gallon reservoir located beneath Penmar Park in the City of Los Angeles into a daily holding tank at Marine Park. The tank would provide storage for the TUR, and a pump system would deliver water from the tank to the irrigation system at Marine Park.

This data would be used to guide the development of a toolkit for use by the City and others. As required by the funding agreement, a copy of the toolkit will be provided to Metro upon completion. Construction is anticipated to begin in March 2017 and be completed by June 2017.  Vendor Selection - Construction On November 10, 2016, the City published Notices Inviting Bids for construction services for the Bike Technology Demonstration Project. The bid was posted on the City's online bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provision. A total of 1,419 vendors were notified and 31 vendors downloaded the bid. One bid was received and publicly opened on December 12, 2016. Staff conducted additional outreach to vendors who downloaded the bid to see why they did not submit a bid. Two responses were received from Aldridge Electric Inc. and E. Republic Company.  Aldridge Electric Inc. did not bid because the project was too small.  E. Republic did not bid because it was not within their specifications.Bid results are as follows:Bidder       Bid AmountElecnor Belco Electric Inc.    $233,600Engineers Estimate     $200,000 The bid was evaluated based on criteria in SMMC 2.24.072, including pricing, understanding of the project scope, direct experience with similar projects, approach to the work, technical competence, qualifications of the proposed staff, and the ability to meet the project schedule. Staff contacted reference agencies listed by the contractor to ascertain past performance on similar projects, including City of Los Angeles, County of Los Angeles and City of Inglewood. Staff also verified with the Contractors State License Board that its subcontractors' licenses are current, active, and in good standing. Based on these criteria, Elecnor Belco Electric Inc., the lowest and only bidder, is recommended as the best bidder for construction services for the Bike Technology Demonstration Project. Construction Management & Public Outreach Construction management and public outreach for this project would be provided by City staff. Construction management would include inspecting the contractor's work during construction, verifying and documenting field changes and unforeseen conditions, monitoring and mitigating impacts as a result of the construction activities, attending contractor's safety meetings, attending periodic progress meetings, and maintaining all necessary inspection documentation relevant to the work conducted during construction. Public outreach would include notifications distributed to adjacent properties and the surrounding community on the scope of the project, potential impacts and schedule with additional periodic updates. ", "background": "The Bicycle Technology Demonstration Project is funded by a 2007 Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority (Metro) Call for Projects grant I which consists of funds from the Federal Highway Administration's Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (\"CMAQ\") program. The City is contributing matching funds as required by federal agreement. The project includes three phases. The first phase, which was completed by Alta Planning and Design, included data collection at the following eight intersections:1. Ocean Avenue and California Ave.2. Broadway and 11th Street3. Olympic Blvd. south and 11th Street4. Lincoln Boulevard and Michigan Avenue5. Pico Boulevard and 11th Street6. 17th Street and Broadway7. Ocean Avenue and Arizona Avenue8. 11th Street and Michigan Avenue Reports were prepared tracking existing conditions at all eight intersections, as well as cycling counts and cyclists behavior as part of the pre-construction study. Three different types of bike detection technologies - microwave, video, and in pavement loops - as well as bike box designs were then selected for five of the eight intersections. The bike box is a type of advance stop line that directs vehicles to stop well short of the cross walk at an intersection, creating an open space (or box) between themselves and the cross walk. This allows bicycles to move into the open space at the front of the queue during the red signal phase, making them more visible, allowing them to correctly position themselves for turning movements and clearing the curb lane for vehicles turning right. The bike box, in addition to correctly positioning the cyclists at the front of the queue, is an advantage for pedestrians since it provides a buffer between vehicles and pedestrians crossing the street. Construction drawings were then developed for these five intersections with selected bicycle detection and bike box designs for each based on best fit of treatment with existing infrastructure and bicycle activity. These drawings were later refined in summer of 2016 by City staff to incorporate striping changes at Broadway and 11th, Michigan and Lincoln Blvd, and Ocean Ave and California, three of the five intersections selected for the study. In November 2016, the drawings went to bid for construction of the improvements and installation of bike racks, which would complete Phase II. Alta Planning will wrap up phase Ill of the project with a post-construction study of the effectiveness of the striping treatment of bike boxes and intersection detection technologies. The before and after data collected by the consultant will be analyzed and used to guide the development of an evaluation toolkit of recommendations for future installations in the City and region. The grant was awarded prior to installation of any boxes in the city and although there are currently some boxes in the city, this project would help evaluate their effectiveness and study the best bicycle detection technologies. ", "summary": "The Bike Technology Demonstration Project will further implement the Bike Action Plan by making cycling more convenient. The project will evaluate three different intersection treatments for bicycles, includes bike boxes, and video and in-pavement bicycle detection devices. Bicycle detection and bicycle striping improvements at five intersections will help cyclists be detected by traffic signals easily and allow them to be up front for better visibility when stopped at intersections. The grant also includes installation of 100 bike racks in locations identified through the Citys existing bike parking request database. In November 2016 the City solicited bids for construction services to install bicycle striping, bicycle detection technologies, bicycle treatments, and bike racks.

CMMS has greatly enhanced the information management and work order processing capabilities of staff.  All Hansen software licenses previously purchased by the City are perpetual and require no renewal. As part of the modification to extend the maintenance term, staff also recommends purchasing mobile software licenses to enhance on-field staffs access to CMMS. Many industries now utilize mobile computing technology to create a relationship between maintenance managers and field technicians. Having the ability to connect to CMMS on mobile devices while on the field, is vital to reshaping the City's asset and maintenance management practices. Some of the benefits would include: faster response times by eliminating extra travel; reduction or elimination of duplicate data entry; and expeditious routing and dispatching of service assignments. Vendor/Consultant SelectionIn 1999, a committee comprised of members from the Utilities Division, and Information System viewed software demonstrations from several computerized maintenance management systems vendors. The evaluation criteria used to rank each vendor included references from similar work, the ability of the vendor to meet the project specifications and the technical environment in which the system would operate. After a competitive process, the Council awarded the contract to Hansen Technologies, Inc.

The Farmers Market sells the bags to its customers at cost and thereby recovers the purchase price of its bags. OSE offers the bags as giveaways in support of the ban on plastic bags, and distributes them to residents at various meetings and events throughout the year for use as alternatives to single use paper and plastic grocery bags. Attachment B provides a comprehensive list of over 100 events where reusable bags were given away during the course of four years.  Although the single-use bag ban has been in effect for more than five years, reusable bags are far from prevalent in the marketplace. Between 3.5 and 3.8 million paper bags are still sold in Santa Monica every year. In addition, heavy-weight plastic carryout bags are being offered for free at a growing number of establishments. Reusable bags remain in high demand as giveaways at events and customers continue to purchase them at Farmers Markets. Although the culture has shifted, work is on-going to ensure that customers select the environmental friendly alternative on an on-going basis. OSE provides these reusable bags free of charge because they are an effective marketing tool and help meet the goals of the single-use carryout bag ban ordinance. Branded collateral is given away at numerous City events each year. Reusable bags are well-received giveaways because they are durable and useful. According to a 2016 Advertising Specialties Impressions study, 77% of people said that they would keep a promotional item if it were useful to them. Additionally, a 2009 study by Promotional Products Association International concluded that 83% of those surveyed liked receiving promotional products, 48% would like to receive them more often, and 69% typically kept them. This same study also showed that logo bags offered a far better return on investment than most marketing tools. The cost-per-impression, which is the typical amount of money spent on a campaign compared to the number of times a customer sees the advertisement, is $0.002 for a logo bag. By comparison, the cost-per-impression of a TV ad (between $0.007 and $0.019) and newspaper ad ($0.033) is significantly higher. Giving out multiple promotional items at a given event is not uncommon and a reusable bag is immediately useful for attendees. OSEs Water Conservation Unit uses reusable bags to put all of its water saving fixtures and outreach materials in one convenient promotional package for residential and commercial customers. S.O. Techs offers a variety of bags, but their standard shopping bag is priced at $4.50 per bag for a minimum order of 500 bags. A search for similar shopping bags made of comparable materials in similar quantities produces a price range of $4.06 to $4.71 per bag, confirming that S.O. Techs prices fall within that range. While less expensive bags are available, the environmental, social, and local economic benefits of partnering with S.O. Tech align directly with the goals of the Sustainable City Plan.Over the next five years, the Farmers Market anticipates purchasing 2,800 regular shopping bags and roughly 600 heavy-duty shopping bags ($14.25 per bag) from S.O. Tech. These purchases would total approximately $24,000.  OSE anticipates ordering approximately 5,000 shopping bags per year over the next five years, totaling roughly $35,000 per year and a potential total cost of $175,000. Therefore, the combined request for budget authority over the next five years is a total of $199,000. Vendor SelectionStaff recommends Special Operations Technologies to furnish and deliver reusable shopping bags as an exception to the competitive process per SMMC Section 2.24.080(d). The bags produced by S.O. Tech. are unique and there is no other similar supplier, due to the fact that they are made locally, by veterans, from repurposed materials, and are free from heavy metals. ", "background": "On February 8, 2011 (Attachment A), Council approved an ordinance banning the use of single-use plastic carryout bags in retail establishments and regulating the use of paper carryout bags. The intent of the ordinance was to reduce the environmental impacts related to single-use plastic and paper carryout bags, and to promote a shift toward the use of reusable bags. At this time, concerns were raised about the durability of inexpensive reusable bags, constructed of poor quality materials. Additional concerns were raised that imported reusable bags could be contaminated with heavy metals or other toxic contaminants. To address all of these concerns, S.O. Tech was selected as the Citys reusable bag vendor. S.O. Tech employs military veterans through The Department of Veterans Affairs West Los Angeles campus to hand-make all of its reusable bags. The City began purchasing reusable bags from S.O. Tech on a sole source basis in December 2009 upon approval from the City Manager. S.O Tech was selected due to the considerable environmental, social and local economic benefits of its operation.  It provides local jobs, thus addressing citizens concerns about loss of jobs from overseas production. Its bags are all hand-made from scrap material that otherwise would have gone to a landfill. Finally, S.O. Tech tests its bags for heavy metal content free of charge to the City, which reduces the overall cost of the bags because outside testing does not need to be procured. In addition, S.O. Tech provides a rehabilitation program to the local homeless veterans who make these bags.  The program provides job training allowing veterans to re-enter the workforce, and has helped several veterans out of homelessness. Procurement of reusable bags from S.O. Tech allows the City to provide reusable bags that are consistent with the goals established in the Sustainable City Plan.  Once the Carryout Bag Ordinance went into effect in 2011, the City pledged to distribute roughly 25,000 reusable bags, free of charge, to the public.

Municipal operators are required to file the SRTP with the regional planning authority in order to maintain eligibility to receive federal and state transit funds. Santa Monicas Big Blue Bus (BBB) has filed this report with Metro for the last 30 years. The SRTP is a planning document that provides a service and systems evaluation, summarizes and evaluates recent accomplishments, provides a three-year action plan for service, operations, and programs, provides a capital improvement program, and the corresponding estimated values for planning purposes. BBB also requests Council action to adopt the updated Drug & Alcohol Program and authorize the City Manager to file grant applications, execute grant agreements and to enter into agreements associated with funding, planning, programming, and implementation of transit services and capital projects. There is no fiscal impact associated with the requested actions. Future fiscal impacts will be considered during the annual budget process.  Discussion Short Range Transit Plan Big Blue Bus is required by the Transportation Development Act (TDA) of 1971 to file an SRTP to maintain eligibility for federal, state, and regional transit funding. The SRTP is a planning document that evaluates accomplishments over the past year and provides a three-year action plan for service, operations, and programs, a capital improvement program, including fleet replacement, facility improvements, equipment modernization, and other infrastructure needs, and the corresponding budget for implementation. The SRTP also serves as an opportunity for staff to outline service improvements, establish industry standards and service planning guidelines, and evaluate system-wide route performance. The FY2017-2019 Short Range Transit Plan includes a brief description of Big Blue Bus service containing route information, service area facts, completed route/service changes, and planned service changes. Service changes implemented since the last SRTP were identified and approved through the Expo Integration Plan (known as Evolution of Blue) that was adopted by City Council on April 28, 2015. Future service changes will be covered in a follow-up study to the Evolution of Blue plan expected to begin in late 2017 (one year after the Evolution of Blue service changes were completed). The follow-up study shall assess all route changes to determine BBBs success in improving ridership and providing reliable, efficient connections with the Expo Line. The results of the follow-up study would shape future improvements beyond 2017. The SRTP also contains an update on any significant capital projects; for example, bus replacements. As part of this ongoing project, BBB accepted 11 new 40-foot buses, 4 30-foot buses, and 7 articulated buses during the last two years and will be accepting 25 additional 40-foot buses between December 2016 and March 2017. The SRTP summarizes BBBs group fare discount program, including with Santa Monica College, UCLA, Saint Johns Health Center, and Unincorporated Los Angeles County areas. The fare discount program is just one of the many initiatives implemented by BBB to benefit the community. Others include regional coordination, digital communications updates, Bus Stop Pride (to further improve the customer experience while awaiting, boarding, or alighting from our buses), transit information improvements, and many more. Big Blue Bus has been working continuously and resolutely to enhance service for its residents, current customers, and future customers. In addition to the description of Big Blue Bus system, service, programs, and projects, the SRTP includes a snapshot of BBB through financial tables, as required by the States Transportation Development Act, including the current fare structure, fleet inventory, financial statement, and a capital project summary. The Short Range Transit Plan document also identifies the projected operating revenue and expenses required to realize the service, programs, and projects contained within the plan. The proposed SRTP financial forecast is based on a combination of BBB' share of Metros countywide formula-based allocation of transit funds and BBBs projected operational needs. The FY 2016-17 estimated formula allocation of operating funds (TDA, State Transit Assistance (STA), Proposition A 40%, Measure R 20%, Proposition C-Security, Foothill Mitigation, and Bus Stop Improvement Program) is $43.6 million, and non-formula allocation (Proposition A and Measure R Local Return) is $1.4 million. Local operating revenues (passenger fares, advertising, interest, lease, and special transit services revenues) are estimated at $18.3 million. AuthorizationStaff requests that Council authorize the City Manager to file grant applications as transit-related funding opportunities become available; to execute grant agreements to accept federal, state, regional and local transit or transit-related funds, as funds are approved or programmed; and, to execute and file certifications and assurances as they relate to grant programs, compliance and project implementation. These authorizations would allow the City to expedite its annual grant applications and participate in unanticipated one-time grant opportunities in a timely manner. Potential funding agencies include, but are not limited to, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and other federal agencies, Metro, the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), State Department of Homeland Security, California Department of Transportation (CalTrans), and other state and regional agencies.  Staff also requests that the City Manager be authorized to enter into agreements including but not limited to, Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs), Letters of Agreement (LOAs), Cooperative Procurement Agreements, and sub-grantee agreements for transit funds and for pass-through funds.

Additional reporting information was also provided for the Childcare Linkage Fee and the Water Demand Mitigation Fee.  An analysis of eligible projects resulted in revisions to the Water Demand Mitigation Fee information and an errata sheet was publicly posted on January 9, 2017.  Child Care Linkage FeeOn December 5, 2006 Council adopted ordinance Chapter 9.65 of the Santa Monica Municipal Code (SMMC) to establish a child care linkage fee program. This fee is intended to address the increased demand for childcare triggered by the development of commercial projects adding floor area of at least 7,500 square feet or multi-family residential projects.  Developers can satisfy the ordinance requirements by either paying a fee or by agreeing to participate in the construction or establishment of one or more child care facilities.  Fees are computed annually on July 1, increasing by a percentage equal to the Construction Cost Index as published by Engineering News Record. Child care linkage fees shall be paid by the final inspection date and prior to the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy. The schedule of the fees for FY 2015-16 were: Residential$142.39 per unitOffice$6.76 per square footRetail$4.84 per square footHotel$3.39 per square foot Following adoption of the ordinance, the City established a Child Care Linkage Fee Reserve Account for the collection of fees to be used to create new child care spaces.  The ordinance requires an annual report to City Council within 180 days after the last day of each fiscal year.  Since adoption of the ordinance in 2006, Council has received an annual update on Child Care Linkage Fee Program revenues with the first actual receipts realized in FY 2012-13 as reported to Council on December 10, 2013. In FY 2015-16, $1,740,158.96 in revenues were collected and interest totaling $10,537.42 was deposited into the Child Care Special Revenue Source Fund Account 4.365203. The revenues collected in FY 2015-16 were added to the prior year Special Revenue Source Fund Account 4.365203 balance of $730,897.74.  The ending balance as of June 30, 2016 for the Special Revenue Source Fund Account 4.365203 totaled $2,481,594.12. No expenditures were made during the fiscal year. Section 9.65.070 of the ordinance specifies that funds collected in the Child Care Linkage Fee Reserve Account shall be restricted to costs related to property acquisition, development, and construction of child care facilities within the City of Santa Monica in addition to any administrative costs incurred by the City to manage the reserve account.  Eligible expenditures shall not include ongoing operating expenses and general maintenance of child care facilities. To date, Council has approved $1,098,598 in available Childcare Linkage Fee funds and $5,563,000 of General Funds for use in the construction of the Early Childhood Lab School (ECLS), formerly the Early Childhood Education Center (ECEC). The Early Childhood Lab School (ECLS), a joint Capital Improvement Project (CIP) of the City of Santa Monica and Santa Monica College (SMC), will provide child care and early education services for up to 110 young children, and is scheduled to break ground in the Civic Center by summer 2017 following permit issuance by the Department of State Architecture and bidding and award of the construction contract by the college. Staff has identified the ECLS as the kind of candidate project that would be eligible for the disbursement of funds from the Child Care Linkage Reserve Account. City staff is working with the City Attorneys Office on administrative guidelines for usage of additional Childcare Linkage Fees and will continue to closely monitor proposed development projects and revenue collection. Transportation Impact FeeThe City Council adopted ordinance Chapter 9.66 of the Santa Monica Municipal Code on March 12, 2013 to establish a Transportation Impact Fee for new development and intensified land uses that will fund transportation improvements such as new sidewalks, crosswalks, traffic signal upgrades, transit, and bicycle facilities that are necessitated by the new trips associated with land use change. The fees are based on residential units or commercial square footage. The fee is charged prior to issuance on building permits, unless State law requires the City to accept later fee payment. The Transportation Impact Fee reflects the costs associated with transportation improvements and the amount of new auto trips that can be attributed to land use changes. The schedule of the fees for the FY 2015-16 were:Single Family, Area 1$8,231.11 per unitSingle Family, Area 2$8,447.72 per unitMulti-Family, Area 1$2,815.91 per unitMulti-Family, Area 2$3,574.04 per unitMulti-Family, Area 3$2,815.91 per unitRetail, Area 1$22.74 per square footRetail, Area 2$32.60 per square footOffice, Area 1$10.51 per square footOffice, Area 2$11.70 per square footMedical Office, Area 1$30.43 per square footMedical Office, Area 2$32.27 per square footHospital, Area 1$0 per square footHospital, Area 2$15.92 per square footLodging, Area 1$3.90 per square footLodging, Area 2$3.90 per square footIndustrial, Area 1$1.30 per square footIndustrial, Area 2$1.41 per square footAuto Sales and Display Areas, Area 1$1.30 per square footAuto Sales and Display Areas, Area 2$1.41 per square foot In FY 2015-16, $2,890,960.62 in revenues were collected and deposited into the Transportation Impact Fee Special Revenue Source Fund Account 4.370332. The revenues collected in FY 2015-16 were added to the prior year Special Revenue Source Fund Account 4.370332 balance of $564,263.54. The ending balance as of June 30, 2016 for Special Revenue Source Fund Account 4.370332 totaled $3,455,224.16. No expenditures were made during the fiscal year.  Funds totaling $1,009,250 have been budgeted to help fund capital projects associated with Safe Routes to Schools and bicycle connections, most visible will be physical changes anticipated next year near four schools to make it easier for students to walk and bike.  The funds may be spent on capital projects and staff to administer the fee; the projects are individually expensive and additional resources to assist with the expenditures have not been allocated.  The Transportation Impact Fees supplement the wide ranging transportation projects that the City implements to improve transportation.  Efforts have recently included completing physical improvements at Expo stations, completing the first year of Breeze bike share service, opening the Colorado Esplanade, a new California Incline structure with dedicated space for pedestrians and cyclists, organizing Coast as the communitys first open streets event, creation of the transportation management organization and promoting all things transportation through the GoSaMo campaign. Staff continues to actively pursue funding though outside sources, including competitive grants.  Maintaining a balance in the account ensures that a local match will be available for grants and then can be allocated once grants are received. Staff will continue to closely monitor proposed development projects and revenue collection, and budget revenues during the 2018-2020 CIP process to help advance capital projects to make it easier for people to walk, bike, and take transit in Santa Monica. Parks and Recreation Development Impact FeeThe City Council adopted ordinance Chapter 9.67 of the Santa Monica Municipal Code on October 14, 2014 to establish a Parks and Recreation Development Impact Fee to provide a direct funding source from new residential and commercial development for the upgrade and/or expansion of parks and recreation facilities needed to accommodate additional occupants of the new developments.  The schedule of the fees for FY 2015-16 were: Single Family Residential$7,809.34 per unitMulti-Family Residential - Studio/1 Bedroom$4,231.93 per unitMulti-Family Residential - 2+ Bedrooms$6,816.30 per unitRetail$1.52 per square footOffice$2.36 per square footMedical Office$1.29 per square footLodging$3.18 per square footIndustrial$1.33 per square foot          In FY 2015-16, $305,285.19 in revenues were collected and deposited into the Parks and Recreation Development Impact Fee Special Revenue Source Fund Account 4.370334. The revenues collected in FY 2015-16 were added to the prior year Special Revenue Source Fund Account 4.370334 balance of $8,276.00. The ending balance as of June 30, 2016 for Special Revenue Source Fund Account 4.370334 totaled $313,561.19. No expenditures were made during the fiscal year. Staff anticipates utilizing the fund balance in FY 2018-19 as a partial funding source for construction of the Airport Park Expansion project. Affordable Housing Commercial Linkage FeeThe City Council adopted ordinance Chapter 9.68 of the Santa Monica Municipal Code on June 23, 2015 to establish the Affordable Housing Commercial Linkage Fee to contribute to the creation of affordable housing production or preservation to offset additional need for affordable housing generated by new commercial development.  The schedule of the fees for FY 2015-16 were: Retail$9.97 per square footOffice$11.46 per square footHotel/Lodging$3.14 per square footHospital$6.28 per square footIndustrial$7.70 per square footCreative Office$9.81 per square footMedical Office$7.05 per square footInstitutional$10.46 per square foot In FY 2015-16, $567,289.43 in revenues were collected and interest totaling $776.10 were deposited into the Affordable Housing Commercial Linkage Fee Special Revenue Source Fund Account 4.365112. The revenues collected in FY 2015-16 were added to the prior year Special Revenue Source Fund Account 4.365112 balance of $21,051.91. The ending balance as of June 30, 2016 for Special Revenue Source Fund Account 4.365112 totaled $589,117.44. No expenditures were made during the fiscal year. As of June 30, 2016, sufficient Affordable Housing Commercial Linkage Fee funds have not been accumulated to complete construction of eligible public improvements. Staff will continue to closely monitor proposed development projects and revenue collection. Water Demand Mitigation FeeThe City Council adopted ordinance Chapter 7.16.050 of the Santa Monica Municipal Code on March 19, 1991 to establish the Water Demand Mitigation Fee. The Water Demand Mitigation Fee is a one-time fee the City charges new development to mitigate the total daily water consumption rate projected for the development. The total daily water demand for the project is calculated using standard water demand factors which have been developed by City staff. The Water Demand Mitigation Fee is set at $3.00 for each gallon of daily water demand that must be mitigated. The fee is required whenever a new single-family residence is constructed or addition of 50% or more to existing square footage; for construction of a new multi-family building or addition of new units; for construction of a new non-residential building or whenever there is a change of use, change or addition to new plumbing fixtures, addition of restaurant seating, or addition of square footage. The schedule of the fees for FY 2015-16 were: Single-Family$990.00 Multi-Family (condominium fees same as apartments):Studio/Single Apartment:$315.00 1 Bedroom Apartment:$375.00 2 Bedroom Apartment:$570.00 3 Bedroom Apartment:$750.00 Duplex (2 Apartments):$900.00 Non-Residential:To be determined by the Civil Engineering Plan Checker             In FY 2015-16, $433,427.65 in revenues were collected and deposited into the fund balance account reserved for Water Demand Mitigation Fee revenues 25.335018. The revenues collected in FY 2015-16 were added to the prior year account 25.335018 balance of $3,638,839.00. In FY 2015-16, $301,375.00 was spent on the Irrigation Controller Replacement project. The purchase of Calsense smart irrigation controllers replaced old irrigation technology at various park and landscape locations citywide. The Calsense smart irrigation controllers, including component parts, were purchased to help increase the Citys water delivery efficiency and staffs ability to monitor irrigation performance, make adjustments remotely and create real time reports related to water use.  Additionally, $59,240 was spent on City landscape and irrigation supplies ($45K) and plumbing fixture retrofits at City facilities ($14K). The ending balance as of June 30, 2016 for account 25.335018 totaled $3,711,651.65. Staff has identified several projects that will utilize the ending fund balance amount at June 30, 2016.          Several facility upgrades, including retrofitting restrooms at City Hall and replacing faucets in the Public Safety Facility building, are scheduled for FY 2016-17 with an estimated cost of $30,308.          In October 2016, in support of meeting Living Building Challenge requirements, an exploratory boring and well construction project was completed on the west side of City Hall to supply the new City Services Building with potable water at a cost of $284,591.          On September 8, 2015, Council awarded Southwest Environmental a $1,999,000 contract to retrofit 4,312 toilets as part of the toilet direct installation program for multi-family properties. Of that total amount, $857,303 will be paid with Water Demand Mitigation funds and the remainder from Bay Saver Fee funds. On September 13, 2016, Council authorized $849,000 for water audits and retrofits at Santa Monica Malibu Unified School District sites within the city.           Public landscape projects include improvements to the irrigation system at Woodlawn Cemetery, to be bid in FY2016-17 with an estimated cost of $60,561. Other landscape projects include the purchase of additional Calsense smart controllers and water efficient rotary nozzles in the amount of $238,326, and an additional $449,052 for landscape and irrigation conversions. The latter represents the second phase of conversions. On June 14, 2016, Council awarded a $700,000 contract to Clean Cut Landscape, Inc. to furnish material and labor for the first phase of the landscape and irrigation conversion project at 39 sites citywide. The project will remove 33,627 estimated square feet (.8 acres) of turf and reduce water use at these 39 sites by roughly 2.4 million gallons a year. Work began in September 2016. In total, the two phases of landscape and irrigation conversions is estimated to cost $1,149,052.          Finally, staff would like to initiate the planning and design of water efficient landscaping and an irrigation system for the San Vicente Blvd. medians, and $242,511 is available to commit to that project. ", "background": "In 1987, the California Legislation passed Assembly Bill 1600 (AB1600), also known as the California Mitigation Fee Act, to codify the legal and procedural parameters for charging development impact fees as set forth in Government Code 66000-66025. A development impact fee is a monetary exaction other than a tax or special assessment that is charged by a local government agency to an applicant in connection with approval of a development project for the purposes of defraying all or a portion of the costs of the public facilities related to the development project.  The Mitigation Fee Act defines public facilities broadly to include public improvements, public services, and community amenities.  At the time that a Mitigation Fee is established, the purpose of the fee and the use to which the fee will be put must be clearly identified. Per Government Code 66006, collection of these fees requires separate funds or accounts to avoid commingling and requires that the following information is reported within 180 days from year-end:1.     A brief description of the type of fee 2.     The amount of the fee 3.     The beginning and ending balances of the account or fund 4.     The amount of the fees collected and interest earned 5.     Identification of each public improvement on which the fees were expended and the amount of the expenditures on each improvement, including the total percentage of the cost of the public improvement that was funded with fees. 6.     An approximate date by which the construction of the public improvement will begin if the City determines that sufficient funds have been collected to complete financing on an incomplete public improvement 7.     A description of any interfund loan or transfer made from the account or fund and the public improvement on which the transferred funds will be expended and in the case of an interfund loan, the date on which the loan will be repaid, and the rate of interest that the account or fund will receive on the loan. 8.     The amount of any refunds made and any allocations of unexpended fees that are not refunded. Per Government Code 66001, the City must report the following on unexpended and expended fee amounts, whether committed or uncommitted, for the fifth fiscal year following the first deposit and every five years thereafter:1.     Identify the purpose to which the fee is to be put 2.     Demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the fee and the purpose for which it was charged 3.     Identify all sources and amounts of funding anticipated to complete financing in incomplete improvements  4.     Designate the approximate dates on which the funding is expected to be deposited into the appropriate account or fund ", "summary": "This report transmits required information for the Citys development impact fees that qualify under Government Code 66000-66025, also known as the Mitigation Fee Act. Pursuant to the Mitigation Fee Act, reporting is required for the following five (5) fees: Childcare Linkage Fee, Transportation Impact Fee, Parks and Recreation Impact Fee, Affordable Housing Commercial Linkage Fee, and Water Demand Mitigation Fee. These fees have been authorized by the City Council to address funding of some of the highest priority long-term needs of the community  childcare, transportation, parks, and affordable housing  that have been directly impacted by the new development.  However, these mitigation fees are only one way that Santa Monica addresses each of these priorities. It can take a number of years to accumulate sufficient funds to implement the relatively high cost of the projects they are eligible to fund.  Staff carefully monitors the balance of funds and works to use the funds to complete eligible projects. Following is a brief summary of each fee, the current balance, and the plans for spending the funds: 1.     Childcare Linkage Fee  This fee is collected to address the increased demand for childcare triggered by the development of commercial projects. As of June 30, 2016, the balance on hand for this fee totaled $2.5 million. Council has approved usage of Childcare Linkage Fee funds and General Fund dollars towards the construction of the Early Childhood Lab School (ECLS), formerly the Early Childhood Education Center (ECEC). 2.     Transportation Impact Fee  This fee is collected on new development and intensified land uses and is used to fund transportation improvements, such as new sidewalks, crosswalks, traffic signal upgrades, transit, and bicycle facilities. As of June 30, 2016, the balance on hand for this fee totaled $3.5 million. Over $1 million in funds have been budgeted to complete potential public improvements. Staff closely monitors proposed development projects and available resources and incorporates these costly projects into the CIP process. 3.     Parks and Recreation Impact Fee  This fee is collected from new residential and commercial development for the upgrade and/or expansion of parks and recreation facilities needed to accommodate additional occupants. As of June 30, 2016, the balance on hand for this fee totaled $0.3 million. Staff anticipates utilizing the fund balance in FY 2018-19 as a partial funding source for construction of the Airport Park Expansion project. 4.     Affordable Housing Commercial Linkage Fee  This fee is designed to contribute to the creation of affordable housing production or preservation to offset additional need for affordable housing generated by new commercial development. As of June 30, 2016, the balance on hand for this fee totaled $0.6 million. Currently, insufficient funds have been collected to complete potential public improvements. Staff will continue to closely monitor proposed development projects and available resources. The information presented in this financial report is provided in compliance with State law requirements and staff continues to monitor development projects and revenue collected to ensure that fees are accounted for and expended in accordance with the purposes for which they were collected as required by law."}, "title": " Annual Reporting of Developer Impact Fees", "Sponsors": null, "recommendations": [""], "Department": "Finance Department, Financial Operations"}, {"title": null}, {"title": null}, {"title": null}, {"title": null}], [], [], [{"Category": "06. Administrative Proceedings", "body": {"other": "Pursuant to SMMC Section 9.42.020, Variances may be granted with respect to development standards by the City Council, on appeal. In addition to the required findings for a Variance, the following issues should be considered by the City Council in its de novo review of the proposed project:          Whether there are special circumstances or exceptional characteristics applicable to the property involved, including size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings, or to the intended use or development of the property that do not apply to other properties in the vicinity under an identical zoning classification.         Whether the strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, not including economic difficulties or economic hardships.         Whether the strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in unreasonable deprivation of the use or enjoyment of the property. Specifically, what would be the nature of the impact on the property owner should the Variance be denied, and whether there are alternatives that would not require the Variance.   In this case, there are special circumstances and unnecessary hardships that are depriving the owner the reasonable use of the property when compared to other similar properties in the neighborhood.  Special Circumstances or Exceptional CharacteristicsThis finding is specific to the subject property having a special circumstance or exceptional characteristic that does not apply to other properties in the vicinity with the same zoning classification. Fundamentally, this finding is based on whether there are unique physical disparities between properties under identical zoning classifications within the area, and whether there are special conditions that are different from the conditions that affect other nearby properties within the same district. The subject parcel is a substandard lot in terms of width, depth, and size. The site measures 30 wide by 94 deep (2,820SF) where a standard lot in this neighborhood is 50 wide by 100 deep (5,000SF). The propertys existing conditions with respect to parcel slope result in the buildings practical first floor to be considered a second floor and likewise, the second floor to be considered a third floor level, which creates a special circumstance with respect to how building design on the site relates to the applicability of the Zoning Ordinance. As shown in Figure 5, the proposed balcony on the technical 3rd floor is less impactful than a code compliant roof deck over a hypothetical 2-story project. If not for the slope of the parcel, this would be a two-story single-family residence with a balcony at the rear that is fully compliant with the development standards of the Zoning Ordinance. The height of the proposed balcony addition and views into neighboring properties are considerably less than a roof deck that could be constructed by right on the property pursuant to the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. Given the existing restrictions, pursuant to the conditions of approval for 13VAR-014 and 03APP-018, and the development standards of the Zoning Ordinance, the roof of the existing structure could be modified to accommodate a roof deck addition to the existing single-family structure without any discretionary approval other than review by the Architectural Review Board. Figure 5: Balcony/Roof Deck ComparisonPractical Difficulties or Unnecessary HardshipsThis finding relates to practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, not including economic hardships that may result from the application of development standards. An unnecessary hardship would be an uncharacteristic feature to a particular property and not general in nature.The determinations for 03VAR-014 and 03APP-018 for the master bedroom addition took into account the sloping characteristic of the site and its relationship to the proposed addition and its physical surroundings as part of the approvals; however, the conditions of approval imposed on the project are unnecessarily more restrictive than the minimum requirements of the Zoning Ordinance to the extent where reasonable enjoyment of the property is deprived. In the R2 (Multi-Unit Residential) Beach Overlay zoning district a minimum 15-foot rear setback is required. Balconies are permitted to project a maximum of four feet into the required rear setback (i.e. 11-foot rear setback for balcony). The decisions made by the Zoning Administrator, and the Planning Commission upon appeal, established an increased rear setback of 25 feet with a maximum balcony projection of three feet on the substandard lot. The setback restrictions were imposed due to concerns raised about privacy and neighborhood compatibility; however, there are a number of other properties in the neighborhood with authorized third story additions that were afforded the opportunity of roof decks and rear balconies that are larger in size and elevated above ground level to enhance the enjoyment of the properties and their proximity to the beach, as demonstrated in Figure 6 below.  Figure 6: Neighborhood Map of Third-Story Variances and Upper Floor Balconies Unreasonable Deprivation or the Use or Enjoyment of the PropertyThis finding relates to unreasonable deprivation of the use or enjoyment of the property that may result from the application of development standards, particularly to proposed balcony. This finding is based on whether requiring the applicant to comply with the Zoning Ordinance prevents the applicant from utilizing the property in substantially the same manner that neighboring properties are or could be utilized. The City Council should assess whether the Variance gives the applicant greater rights than would be available to surrounding neighbors.To date, the City has granted seven third story variances, including the subject site, within an approximate 300-foot radius of the subject property, all of which are listed below in Figure 7 and highlighted in Figure 6 above. All of these properties have similar site conditions as the subject property in terms of lot size, configuration and grade. All of the structures on these properties are technically three-story structures because the finished elevation of the raised first floor is more than three feet above the sites average natural grade level.  Figure 7: Subject Sites with 3rd Story Variances Project No. 129 Fraser Avenue40 x 94/3,760SFVAR00-004140 Fraser Avenue37.5 x 94/3,519SFVAR02-009144 Fraser Avenue-(Subject site)30 x 94/2,820SFVAR03-014157 Fraser Avenue35 x 94/3,290SFVAR98-052125 Ocean Park Blvd25 x 94/2,350SFVAR09-007124 Hart Avenue 20 x 94/1,880SFVAR03-005142 Hart Avenue 25 x 94/2,350SFVAR04-009Additionally, there are many existing structures with roof decks and elevated rear balconies, as shown in Figure 8 below. The subject block of Fraser Avenue has 30 lots and approximately 14 of those lots (46%) have permitted decks or balconies located in the rear yard setback that are located at the upper floor levels. Two of those lots, 140 (adjacent to the subject site) and 132 Fraser Avenue have roof decks located above single story garages that are built at the rear property line.       Figure 8: Neighborhood Context  The 100 block of Ocean Park Boulevard has 15 lots and approximately 8 of those lots (53%) have permitted decks or balconies located in the rear yard setback that are either at the upper floor or roof deck levels. Four of the lots (141,137, 133 and 125 Ocean Park Boulevard) have permitted roof decks at or above the height of the proposed balcony at 144 Fraser Avenue. The 100 block of Hart Avenue to the south has 18 lots and 10 of those lots (55%) have permitted decks or balconies located in the rear yard setback that are at the upper floor levels.  The proposed third floor balcony expansion is consistent with the prevailing neighborhood characteristics as approximately 32 of the 63 lots (51%) within an approximate 300 foot radius of the subject site have decks or balconies at the upper floor or roof deck level. The applicants proposed balcony expansion to 175 square feet is consistent with the size and location of most other upper floor balconies in the neighborhood. The proposed balcony at 144 Fraser Avenue would be setback 17 feet from the rear property line and would not encroach into the required rear yard setback of 15 feet and the required side yards of 4 feet.  As such, the owner of the subject property was unreasonably deprived of the enjoyment and use of the property, as compared to other properties in the neighborhood. Neighborhood Compatibility The proposed variance modification would not impair the integrity and character of the district in which it is to be located in that the proposed third floor balcony expansion is consistent with the prevailing characteristics of the neighborhood. The majority of the existing residences within an approximate 300 foot radius of the subject property, which are identified in Figure 4 below, have upper level balconies located in the rear yards.  Appeal SummaryOn May 12, 2016, the appellant filed an appeal of the Planning Commissions approval of the Variance. The full text of the appeal is presented in Attachment B. The appellants appeal statement explaining the reasons for the appeal are based on four primary points as summarized below:1. The Planning Commissions findings were subjective and not relative to who is directly impacted and therefore not justified.  2. The appellant states that there are design-related issues due to removal of the roof mass encompassing the sides of the current balcony. Replacement of the roof mass with the proposed balcony railings would further impact the adjacent neighbors.  3. The appellant questions findings made in relation to height, massing, and pedestrian orientation. The existing height of the residence and deck expansion, if granted, would dominate over adjacent neighbors backyards.  4. The appeal is to restrain or minimize the expansion of the third floor deck that was granted by modifying conditions Nos. 7 & 8 of the previously approved Variance 03-014. The size of the expansion greatly and adversely impacts and lessens the adjacent neighbors privacy. Appeal AnalysisThe Council, in its de novo review of this appeal, must determine whether the proposed project meets the findings required for a Variance identified in SMMC Section 9.24.040, provided in Attachment A. The Council may uphold the appeal or uphold the decision of the Planning Commission, in whole or in part, based upon these findings.As noted above the appellant has identified four points for overturning the Planning Commissions decision. However, staff does not agree with the appellants appeal statement for the following reasons:1. The appellants first point concerns that the findings were subjective and not relative to who is directly impacted and therefore not justified. Staff contends that the project meets all of the required findings for a Variance as provided in Attachment A. The propertys existing conditions with respect to parcel slope result in the buildings practical first floor to be considered a second floor and likewise, the second floor to be considered a third floor level, which creates a special circumstance with respect to how building design on the site relates to the applicability of the Zoning Ordinance. The conditions of approval restricting the size and location of the rear balcony created an unnecessary hardship that is more restrictive than the minimum requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, and result in an unreasonable deprivation of the use of the property as compared to the other properties in the neighborhood.  2. The appellants second point contends there are design-related issues resulting from removal of the roof mass encompassing the sides of the existing deck. Replacement with the requested balcony railings would only further impact the adjacent neighbors. In deciding to the approve the Variance, the Planning Commission reviewed the proposed balcony and found that the removal of the roof massing to accommodate for the balcony expansion would actually reduce the massing at the rear elevation of the residence, therefore making the residence appear less dominating. The 126 square foot balcony will remain within the mass of the existing residence and will be set back 3 feet from the sides of the existing residence. The balcony will serve to permit outdoor activity that does not offer considerable visual access to adjacent private yards, thereby mitigating potentially detrimental impacts on adjacent neighbors. In addition, since the balcony is accessed from the master bedroom, it is unlikely to be a location where significant social activities will occur.  3. The appellants third point concerns the findings made in relation to height, massing, and pedestrian orientation. The existing height of the residence and deck expansion, if granted, would dominate over adjacent neighbors backyards. Staff contends that the existing height of the residence would actually appear less dominant due to the removal of the roof massing as indicated above. Further, staff believes the proposed balcony extension would not materially change the existing development on the site and would not be visible from the street. The prevailing street character will remain unchanged and the existing single-family residence would continue to be compatible in size and function to the surrounding residential neighborhood.  4. Lastly, the appellants fourth point concerns the size of the expansion greatly and adversely impacts and lessens the adjacent neighbors privacy. Staff contends that restricting the existing third floor balcony beyond 24 square feet would limit the property owners use and enjoyment of their property and causing the subject property to be unreasonably deprived compared with other properties in the immediate neighborhood that have larger size balconies located in the rear yard. The third floor balcony expansion is consistent with the prevailing characteristic of the neighborhood with approximately 32 of the 63 lots (51%) within an approximate 300 foot radius of the subject site have decks or balconies at the upper floor or roof deck level. Furthermore, staff believes due to the relatively small size of the approved balcony and its location from an upper-level master bedroom, the balcony does not have a natural propensity towards group activities that may generate higher noise levels than similar neighboring properties with balconies located in the rear yard and accessible from living areas within a residence. The third floor balcony is also significantly smaller in area than what would be permitted by code (360 square feet) and will be setback 17 feet from the rear property line and well within the required 4 foot side yard setbacks.  As detailed in the project and appeal analysis, there are special circumstances surrounding the proposed project and the subject site that warrant the support of the Variance request to extend the balcony. In summary, the site is a sloping lot, which establishes a special circumstance where the technical third story requires the consideration of a Variance. Furthermore, balconies are viewed by the Zoning Ordinance as building projections and not a part of the building volume that would otherwise be subject to the minimum setback requirements.  While the consideration of the Variance request allows the decision-maker the discretion to take into account impacts to the neighborhood, the conditions of approval restricting the size and location of the rear balcony created an unnecessary hardship that is more restrictive than the minimum requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, and result in an unreasonable deprivation of the use of the property as compared to the other properties in the neighborhood, as evidenced by the other third story additions and existing sizeable roof decks and rear balconies.  As proposed, the size and the location of the balcony complies with the setback and building volume envelope requirements of the Zoning Ordinance and would not grant any special rights to the property owner nor excessively impede upon the privacy of adjacency lots in any way that goes beyond the rights expressly granted by the Zoning Ordinance. The proposed balcony extension would not materially change the existing development on the site and would not be visible from the street. The prevailing street character will remain unchanged and the existing single-family residence would continue to be compatible in size and function to the surrounding residential neighborhood. Requiring the property owner to comply with the conditions of approval from the previously approved Variance imposes a hardship that prevents the applicant from utilizing the property in substantially the same way that neighboring properties are, or could be, utilized. Community OutreachThe applicant has informed staff that significant neighborhood outreach has been conducted on their part by personally contacting each owner and resident along the 100 block of Fraser and Ocean Park Boulevard to explain and describe the project scope.Alternatives As an alternative to the staff recommendation, the Council may consider the following with respect to the pending appeals if supported by the full evidentiary record: 1. Uphold Variance (15ENT-0304) and deny 16ENT-0068 submitted by the appellant. 2. Articulate revised findings and/or conditions to Approve OR Deny the subject appeal. Environmental StatusThe project is categorically exempt from the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) pursuant to Section 15301 Class 1 and 15331 Class 31, of the State Implementation Guidelines in that the project involves a minor alteration and 151-square third floor balcony expansion to an existing three-story building listed on the Citys Historic Resources Inventory. The subject property is located in the South Beach District and is listed on the historic resources inventory with a 5B status code. This evaluation code means that the structure appears to contribute to a potential historic district. The planned balcony addition appears to be consistent with the standards for maintenance, repair, and reconstruction as set forth in the Secretary of the Interiors Standards for Rehabilitation of historic properties. The historic character of the building will be maintained and no historic features or elements will be replaced or irreparably affected.There is no immediate financial impact or budget action necessary as a result of the recommended action.", "background": "Existing Conditions and SettingThe subject property is a 2,820-square foot parcel measuring 30-feet wide by 94-feet deep. It is located on the south side of Fraser Avenue, between Neilson Way and Barnard Way. The parcel slopes downward from the front property line toward the rear property line and has an elevation difference of approximately 4.25-feet from front to rear. The site is improved with a single-family residence. Although it appears to be a two-story residence when viewed from the street, the structure is technically a three-story structure because the finished elevation of the raised first floor is more than three feet above the sites average natural grade level. As a result, the basement level beneath the first floor is considered the first story as defined by Section 9.52.020.0230 of the Zoning Ordinance. Consequently, the first floor is defined as the second story and the second floor is defined as the third story. Surrounding land uses consist of a mix of one- and two-story single-family residences in the R2 Beach Overlay Zoning district.Figure 1: Photo of Existing Residence  The relevant permit history for the site is described below.  2003 Original Variance RequestOn October 14, 2003, the Zoning Administrator considered a Variance request for a 140 square foot addition with a 25-foot rear yard setback and a 219 square foot balcony on the third story of the existing single-family residence. Due to the sites sloping characteristics, the proposed addition was considered a third story to the structure, pursuant to the standards of the Zoning Ordinance, where a maximum allowable height of two stories and 30 feet are permitted. Beyond the technical aspect of the addition being defined as a third story, the existing structure and the proposed addition were in compliance with all the development standards of the Zoning Ordinance including being within the maximum building envelope, a maximum allowable building height of 30 feet, a minimum rear setback of 15 feet, and a maximum lot coverage of 50%.  Ultimately, the Zoning Administrator determined that the proposed third floor addition and balcony had the potential to adversely impact the privacy of adjacent properties. The Zoning Administrator found that while the balcony was intended for outdoor use, the proposed size and location of the balcony had the potential to encourage significant outdoor activity on a narrow parcel and at an elevated location. As a result, the Zoning Administrator approved Variance 03VAR-014 for a technical third story addition with a 25-foot rear setback. The decision also included a condition of approval that no balcony shall be permitted on the third floor level. The Zoning Administrator determination prohibiting a third floor balcony was appealed by the property owner.2004 Appeal of Variance to Planning CommissionOn February 8, 2004, the Planning Commission considered Appeal 03APP-018. The minutes of this Planning Commission meeting are included as Attachment F to this staff report. The Planning Commission determined that the proposed design of the 219 square foot third floor balcony had the potential to impact the privacy of adjacent properties in that it would permit outdoor activity that offered considerable visual access to adjacent private yards. Therefore, the Planning Commission upheld the Zoning Administrators decision to approve the Variance request with modifications to the project design. Specifically, the Zoning Administrator condition of approval prohibiting a third floor balcony was removed, and the following conditions of approval Nos. 6-8 were added to maintain the 25-foot rear setback, as proposed in the applicants design, and to allow a modest balcony to project beyond the third floor addition that was inset into the center of the buildings rear elevation.   03APP-018 Conditions of Approval:   The Planning Commission determined that the revised balcony design better addressed privacy concerns generated by the layout of the balcony, and concerns relative to significant outdoor activity had been reduced to acceptable levels due to the width, depth, and area of the balcony. Due to the small size of the balcony, the Planning Commission concluded that it no longer had a natural propensity towards group activities that may generate higher noise levels and pulling the balcony location farther back from the rear and side property lines reduced views into adjacent parcels. The conditions of approval establish a maximum balcony size of 24 square feet, with a 22-foot rear setback and 11-foot side setbacks on a 30-foot wide property. The existing balcony is shown in Figure 2 below.Figure 2: Photo of Existing Balcony (24 SF)Project Description On September 10, 2015, the applicant filed Variance 15ENT-0304 requesting to remove the conditions of approval limiting the size and location of balcony to allow an 8-00 x 21-09 (175SF) balcony that is setback 17 feet from the rear property line, and more than 4 feet from both the north and south side property lines, respectively, as shown in Figure 3 below.  Figure 3: Requested Third Floor Balcony Expansion  May 11, 2016: 15ENT-0304: The Planning Commission approved the Variance request to allow for a 126 square foot third floor balcony that extends to the existing rear edge of the building and is setback 3 feet from the existing side elevations of the building, superseding Condition Nos. 7 and 8 of the previously approved Variance 03-014 as included in the Statement of Official Action (Attachment C).2016 Planning Commission Action On May 11, 2016, the Planning Commission reviewed and approved Variance 15ENT-030 with conditions and modifications to the applicants proposal. The Commissions discussion focused on the size and location of the existing balcony in comparison to surrounding properties and addressing privacy concerns raised by adjacent neighbors.As discussed, Conditions Nos. 7 and 8 of 03VAR-014 places location limitations on the existing balcony and limited its size to a maximum of 24 square feet. The applicants proposed Variance amendment requested that these conditions be eliminated. The Commission found that in order to allow for reasonable outdoor space comparable to adjacent neighbors and to mitigate privacy impacts to adjacent neighbors, a 126 square-foot, third-floor balcony would be appropriate. The Commissions decision amended and superseded the conditions of previously approved Variance 03-014. The Commissions approval limiting the size and location of the balcony to allow an 8-00 x 15-9 (126SF) that extends to the existing rear edge of the building (17 feet from the rear property line) and is set back 3 feet from the existing side edges of the building. The Commissions approval is illustrated in Figure 4.Figure 4: Planning Commissions Approved Third Floor Balcony Expansion ", "summary": "The owner of 144 Fraser Avenue wishes to extend a balcony on the top floor of the property. While appearing to be a two story home from the street, special circumstances require this home be defined as a three story home, requiring the owner receive approval on the variance from the Planning Commission. On May 11, 2016, the Planning Commission approved Variance 15ENT-0304 to increase the size of the existing third floor balcony along the rear building elevation of an existing single family home at 144 Fraser. The Planning Commission approval authorized a 126 square-foot third floor balcony that extends to the existing rear edge of the building and is setback three feet from the existing side elevation of the building. The Appellant, Maud Orwitz, filed an appeal of the Planning Commissions approval on May 12, 2016. The appellant requests that City Council overturn the Planning Commissions approval of Variance 15ENT-0304, stating that the findings cannot be made or justified, and conditions of approval to expand the existing third floor balcony do not sufficiently mitigate the impacts to the adjacent neighbors privacy. This report summarizes the Planning Commissions action, the points of each appeal provided by the appellant, and staffs analysis. This report concludes with a recommendation from staff to uphold the Variance approval based upon the findings and subject to the conditions adopted by the Planning Commission on May 11, 2016.

Administrative Proceedings", "body": {"other": "Appeal AnalysisThe Councils consideration of this appeal is de novo, which means that Council must approve or conditionally approve the DR Permit application in whole or part if all of the following required findings of fact can be made in an affirmative manner (SMMC Section 9.40.050): A.     The physical location, size, massing, setbacks, pedestrian orientation, and placement of proposed structures on the site and the location of proposed uses within the project are consistent with applicable standards and are both compatible and relate harmoniously to surrounding sites and neighborhoods; B.     The rights-of-way can accommodate autos, bicycles, pedestrians, and multi-modal transportation methods, including adequate parking and access; C.    The health and safety services (police, fire etc.) and public infrastructure (e.g., utilities) are sufficient to accommodate the new development; D.    The project is generally consistent with the Municipal Code, General Plan, and any applicable Specific Plan; E.    Based on environmental review, the proposed project has no potentially significant environmental impacts or any potentially significant environmental impacts have been reduced to less than significant levels because of mitigation measures incorporated in the project or a Statement of Overriding Considerations has been adopted; F.    The project promotes the general welfare of the community; G.   The project has no unacceptable adverse effects on public health or safety; and H.   The project provides Community Benefits consistent with Chapter 9.23.  In his appeal statement (Attachment C), the appellant challenged the following findings and conditions contained in the Planning Commissions Statement of Official Action: Findings A, C, D, G, and Conditions of Approval Nos. 6, 15 and 17. However, staff does not agree with the appellants appeal statement and the following discussion summarizes and provides staffs analysis of each of the appeal points. Finding A Appeal SummaryIn approving the DRP, the Commission found that: The physical location, size, massing, setbacks, pedestrian orientation, and placement of proposed structures on the site and the location of proposed uses within the project are consistent with applicable standards and are both compatible and relate harmoniously to surrounding sites and neighborhoods in that the project is located in the Civic Core section of the Civic Center Specific Plan area, complies with the CCSP development standards, and is a public building that is part of the CCSP's program to provide government offices necessary to serve the City's community.  (Note: the Finding is based on an assumption of Council approval of the recommended CCSP amendment.) The appellant states that he is concerned that the proposed \"massing\" overhangs the historic City Hall building on the south side as it projects all the way to the sidewalk and disturbs the historically significant streetscape view of City Hall from Main Street. He requests that other building massing options be considered, including options that would be taller but on a smaller footprint. Finding A ResponseThe project design does extend south of City Halls southern wall, as seen in the site plan above. However, it is set back and does not project all the way to the sidewalk, as stated by the appellant. From the sidewalk, a stairway and ADA-compliant ramps lead down to the building entrance and a small landscaped plaza. At the Planning Commission hearing, there was discussion of how this projection impacts the view of the Public Safety Facility (PSF). While the pathway on the south side of City Hall would no longer have an open view of PSF, the view from the Olympic Drive sidewalk would remain open and the PSF and its plaza would be visible from the street.  Although the proposed building is visible from Main Street at Olympic Drive, it would not be visible from the front of City Hall, or from most views along Main Street. The appellants suggestion of a taller building might, in fact, have more visibility from Main Street than the project approved by the Planning Commission. In addition, the appellant refers to the historically significant streetscape view of City Hall from Main Street. Staff disagrees on the historic significance of the referenced view shed, as neither the Olympic Avenue streetscape nor the PSF, which were both constructed in the current century, were present during City Halls period of historic significance (1938-1951).  Finding C Appeal SummaryIn approving the DRP, the Commission found that: The health and safety services (police, fire etc.) and public infrastructure (e.g., utilities) are sufficient to accommodate the new development in that the proposed building is located in an urbanized area already adequately served by existing City infrastructure. The appellant states that he is concerned that the proposed City Services Building project plan includes the building's own water well and that the location is quite close to the Pacific Ocean, over time, this well may produce water infused with salt.  This would necessitate the inclusion of a desalination plant inside the building.  The appellant requests a cost-benefit analysis be done on this proposal.  Finding C ResponseThe CSB will be connected to the citywide water system, which will initially serve the building until the County approves use of the well and will remain as back-up if needed.  The Citys Water Division is responsible for obtaining all required State and County approvals. A test well was dug in November and results indicated that water can be supplied to the building from this source. The water table accessed by this well is located well above the current level of saltwater intrusion, and data from Sea Level Rise studies recently shared with the City do not indicate that the Civic Center is vulnerable to rising water tables. However, even in the unlikely event of salt water intrusion into the groundwater source of the well, the building will be connected to the City's municipal potable water supply as a redundant system. Consequently, the City's municipal infrastructure would be sufficient to provide potable water to the building in the event that the well became inoperative for any reason.  Finding D Appeal SummaryIn approving the DRP, the Commission found that:The project is generally consistent with the Municipal Code, General Plan, and Civic Center Specific Plan in that it is for the construction of a necessary government facility in the Civic Center identified in the CCSP and complies with applicable Zoning Code and CCSP requirements. The appellant states his concern that the proposed project conflicts with SMMC Section 5.20.060, which prohibits private sewer systems. He also disputes this finding by objecting to the locational choice for the building, claiming that too much is being attempted for this small footprint location. He requests a full discussion of other possible locations. Finding D ResponseSMMC 5.20.60 (Septic tanks, seepage pits and cesspool connections (private sewage disposal systems) was enacted to remove private, uncontrolled sewer systems in order to ensure groundwater safety. This project proposes a self-contained composting system in a public (City) building, processed by machinery that would be located in the buildings basement. The unusual system is a component of the effort to achieve a zero-waste building for the Living Building Challenge.  The appellants claim that the finding of Code consistency cannot be made due to conflicts with this Code section is a misinterpretation of the referenced Municipal Code section. SMMC 5.20.060 does not apply to a publicly-owned waste system. Furthermore, the building will be connected to the Citys municipal sewer system as a back-up for waste disposal if needed. Finding D addresses objective compliance with Municipal Code and General Plan requirements. The appellants statement that the site area is too small for the project does not specifically address objective factors that support this claim. Code limitations on height and density, as well as design parameters such as setbacks and stepbacks are the most commonly used objective measures for determining whether a building fits in its proposed location. In this instance, the project is subject to CCSP standards, which support flexible building design for the public buildings that make up the Civic Center. CCSP standards reflect that the Civic Center is not a typical neighborhood in which new development directly impacts adjacent private properties. Should Council approve the proposed CCSP amendment to permit a City services building of up to 55,000 SF in the location behind City Hall, the project as approved would be consistent with the CCSP, which is the only objective standard of fit for this DRP application. The appellant has also challenged the choice of building location as inconsistent with the Municipal Code or the general plan. The selection of the site was made by the City Council in 2012, after public consideration of alternative sites, including the site adjacent to the north side of City Hall and other non-adjacent locations in the Civic Center. The Council chose the current site after considering all of the advantages and drawbacks of these alternatives. This process was outlined in Council staff report for the January 27, 2015 meeting. As a result, a DRP application was submitted for 1685 Main Street, and this is the only alternative that may be evaluated under this application. Finding G Appeal Summary In approving the DRP, the Commission found that:The project has no unacceptable adverse effects on public health or safety in that the Living Building Challenge goals that the building is designed to achieve aim to promote a higher level of well-being and community health through materials, natural light and air and other structural systems.The appellant challenges this finding, stating that: Because of the possible health risks to City staff, maintenance contractors and the general public due to the potential for the spread of dangerous pathogens related to the project's Composting Toilets and the plans to spread the compost material around City Hall planting areas, we request that before any final approval is granted to this project that the City Council first direct staff to consult a professional industrial hygienist and for the consultant to prepare a report on the proposed City Services Building sewage system and compost distribution to be presented at a public meeting. In our cursory investigation and research we have found that a Composting Toilet system of this extensive capacity is unproven and does not currently exist anywhere in the United States. We have found various professional reports stating that the composting process does not reach temperature levels sufficient to kill off human pathogens and that because of this the proposed project stands to put City staff at risk. Finding G ResponseThe appellant submitted a written comment to the Planning Commission with similar concerns during the public comment period, and Commissioners requested further explanation at the November 16th hearing. The Citys Green Building Advisor addressed the Commission to explain the teams research which led to the particular aerobic composter system, which is operated in other North American buildings including the Bullitt Center in Seattle. He stated that public health and protection of employee well-being are priorities for this and any other City project. Additional information provided by the Green Building Advisor is included as Attachment F. Furthermore, the installation of the system requires a permit to be issued by the Los Angeles County Health Department.  The appellants claim that the compost produced from this system will be spread around City Hall landscaped areas is also incorrect; compost product is planned to be sent to a compost producer for mixture with other sources prior to its distribution and use. The DRP allows but does not require the composting waste system, and the project would still be in compliance with the DRP if the system were to be removed from the final plans and a traditional sewer connection provided.  In addition to the Findings challenges, the appellant objected to three conditions of the projects approval in his appeal. Condition #6 Appeal SummaryCondition 6: The proposed building has been designed to qualify for certification under the Living Building Challenge of the International Living Future Institute. Although achievement of this certification is not a condition of approval for this permit, the applicant will make every effort to endeavor to be full LBC Certified or at least LBC petal certified.The appellants concern with this condition is that in attempting to qualify for this level of \"sustainable\" certification the City Services Building project has become \"financially\" unsustainable. We would like to see a complete cost-benefit analysis regarding the issue of \"green sustainability\" versus ultimate \"financial sustainability\" including a discussion of the long-term maintenance of the building's unproven subsystems and what taxpayers should be expected to pay for City staff office space. This analysis should include costs of recently constructed \"typical\" city office space in other southern California municipalities. As a point of reference, let us compare the presently proposed City Services Building project to the recently opened LEED Gold - African American History & Culture Museum on the National Mall in Washington DC. This new Smithsonian building is built at a very high quality and cost $270 million for 350,000 square feet. This works out to about $771 per square foot. The Santa Monica City Services Building, at its current $86 million budget and 50,000 square feet will cost more than twice as much at $1720 per square foot. Condition #6 ResponseThe City Council's decision to authorize design of the building to qualify for certification under the Living Building Challenge of the International Living Future Institute was made at a public meeting after full consideration of costs and benefits (see January 27, 2015 Council staff report). More importantly, as long as the findings under SMMC 9.40.050 can be made for the currently contemplated design of the building, it is not necessary to condition approval of the DR Permit upon future certification or best efforts for certification. Therefore, staff is recommending that the DRP be approved without Condition 6 (see Attachment A) to avoid confusion. Condition #15 Appeal SummaryCondition 15: This approval is for those plans dated August 31, 2016, as modified by the site plans presented at the Planning Commission hearing on November 16, 2016, in regard to placement of equipment, bike and vehicular parking, and solar arrays. A copy of these plans shall be maintained in the files of the City Planning Division. Project development shall be consistent with such plans, except as otherwise specified in these conditions of approval.The appellant states that he is concerned that there is a rush to start the permit application process before January 1st, 2017, as apparently, earthquake codes will be changing. For the large expense of the new City Services Building per square foot, there is a concern for the reasons why these new structural steel design codes were not considered. It would seem that any new municipal building should set an example for others to follow, not to skirt. We would like to see an analysis of the reasons to \"rush\" this building and not take all new earthquake code requirements into consideration. Condition #15 ResponseCondition 15 is a standard condition that references the plans that the Planning Commission reviewed and approved. This plan set does not include the structural detail required by the Building and Safety Division for their plan check process. Those plans are submitted as a separate plan check application, evaluated on the basis of applicable codes. Furthermore, the DRP analysis and findings are not related to the applicants project timing. This point of appeal is, therefore, not relevant to the referenced condition of approval. The recommended Condition (14) in the draft Council Statement of Official Action references a revised set of plans as approved by the Planning Commission.  Condition #17 Appeal SummaryCondition 17: Project plans shall be subject to complete Code Compliance review when the building plans are submitted for plan check and shall comply with all applicable provisions of Article IX of the Municipal Code and all other pertinent ordinances and General Plan policies of the City of Santa Monica prior to building permit issuance.Similar to Finding D above, the appellant states that The proposed City Services Building project appears to conflict with City Code 5.20.060 - No private sewage disposal systems shall be permitted within the City. All such systems must be removed and the lots thereto attached connected to the public sewer system. The connection to the public sewer system in accordance with Chapter 7.04 and this Chapter of this Code, must be completed by July 1, 1987. The removal of the private sewage disposal system must be completed by October 1, 1987. Condition #17 ResponseCondition 17 is a standard advisory to applicants that the project will be required to comply with all relevant Code sections. As stated in the above response to the appellants challenge of Finding D, the Code section referenced by the appellant applies only to private systems and in any case the CSB will have a back-up connection to the sewer system.  Based upon the foregoing, staff recommends approval of the DRP as set forth in the draft Statement of Official Action (Attachment A).  Environmental ReviewAn Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was prepared for the Civic Center Specific Plan (CCSP) project in accordance with Section 15087 of the State CEQA Guidelines. The CCSP EIR, certified on June 28, 2005, analyzed the development of a mix of future land uses as well as circulation improvements in the Civic Center Specific Plan area. The CCSP EIR included the analysis of a potential City Services Building up to 100,000 sf and 56 feet in height on Fujinomiya Douri, north of City Hall. Subsequent to certification of the EIR, five addenda were prepared and published to address changes in the Civic Center Specific Plan. Per Section 15164 of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) guidelines, an Addendum to a certified EIR is required if minor technical changes or minor modifications to the proposed project occur. Preparation of an addendum is appropriate unless subsequent changes proposed in the project or changed circumstances will result in new significant impacts or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant impacts will occur.  To determine whether the proposed alterations to the CSB would have new or more severe significant environmental impacts that were not previously analyzed in the CCSP EIR and the five addenda, a Sixth Addendum to the CCSP EIR (Attachment E) was prepared for the proposed project. All potential areas of impact were studied, with particular discussion on some including Historic Preservation (discussed above), Traffic and Circulation, and Construction Effects. As analyzed in the Addendum, the CSB project as proposed would not generate new significant environmental impacts or a substantial increase in the severity of previously significant impacts identified in the 2005 Civic Center Specific Plan EIR. Therefore, pursuant to CEQA, preparation of a subsequent or supplemental EIR is not required. Public OutreachPublic notices for the November 2, 2016 Planning Commission hearing (and its continuance to November 16, 2016) and for this Council hearing were provided as required by the Zoning Code. Notices were mailed to surrounding properties and an advertisement was placed in the Santa Monica Daily Press. Two notices, one on each street frontage of City Hall, were posted as required prior to each public hearing. AlternativesAs an alternative to the staff recommendation, the Council may choose to grant the appeal based on revised findings and deny the DRP (16ENT-140) and the proposed CCSP Amendment (separate agenda item). ", "background": "Existing Conditions and SettingCity Hall is on a parcel that also includes the Public Safety Facility (PSF) and the Civic Center Parking Garage. The PSF building, to the east of City Hall, was completed in 2003 and was the first City facility to be awarded the US Green Building Councils LEED Silver certification. PSF has balconies facing City Hall and a corner entrance plaza on Olympic Drive. In between PSF and City Hall is a three-sided courtyard of approximately 8,000 square feet that opens toward a service road (Avenida Mazatlan). The courtyard includes landscaping (installed as temporary in 2005), picnic benches, bike parking and a semi-circular walkway that pays homage to the original road behind City Hall. Also on the site to the north of City Hall is a 30-space surface parking lot, mechanical equipment, and refuse/recycling bins. The I-10 freeway borders the property on the north.Special considerations for the projects building design are the propertys status as a City Landmark (and Landmark parcel) and the Councils direction to design the project to achieve certification through the Living Building Challenge, which requires registration and going through the certification process of the International Living Futures Institute (ILFI). The building aims to be compatible yet distinct from the Landmark while reflecting current technology and environmental sensibilities to create a building that is self-sufficient in its energy and water use.  The City Services Building requires consistency with the Secretary of Interiors Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties (SOI Standards), and a Certificate of Appropriateness to be approved the Citys Landmarks Commission. In addition, an amendment to the Civic Center Specific Plan (CCSP) is required in order to approve the proposed project, because the CCSP specifies a different location for this anticipated additional government office space.   Aerial View and Map of Site LocationZoning District:CCLand Use Element Designation:Institutional/Public LandsParcel Area:7.36 acresExisting On-Site Improvements (Year Built):City Hall (1939), Public Safety Building (2003), Ken Genser Square (2014)Adjacent Land Uses:Tongva Park; County CourthouseHistoric Resource InventoryDesignated City Landmark (1979) Project DescriptionThe project, known as the City Services Building (CSB), is located on a City Landmark-designated parcel. The proposed extension on the east side of City Hall would form an enclosed courtyard with City Hall, with its rear elevation facing Avenida Mazatlan and the Public Safety Building. The proposed City Services Building (CSB) is a 50,200 square-foot, three-story (45 feet) plus basement addition to the rear of the 1939 Moderne Style City Hall Building, along Avenida Mazatlan, covering some of the eastern portion of the City Hall courtyard to create a 6,700 square-foot, four-sided interior courtyard. Although it will appear to be part of the building, the CSB is being designed as a structurally separate building. Small, accessory structures, including a solar port, RRR enclosures and bike lockers, are also proposed on the site. The proposed project includes the removal of some original building components: 1) an exterior stairwell on the buildings north wing; and 2) the rear 37 feet of the south wing, which originally housed the Citys Fire Department and specifically the firetruck bays. The eastern building walls that will be adjacent to the CSB wing will remain but a total of seven windows (one on the south wing and six on the north wing) would be removed and filled in to create a 3-hour fire wall together with the walls of the new structure. The windows to be removed are not original; they are compatible in-kind replacements installed in the original openings that were revealed when the police building was removed. Another minor alteration to City Halls exterior is the conversion of one window at the eastern end of the south faade of City Hall to an egress door for fire exit requirements. The existing historic sash and frame will be removed, the sill will be cut down to floor level, and a new door assembly will be installed. The replacement of one existing window with a new door will be a minor alteration on a secondary faade and will have minimal visual and material impact on the buildings historic integrity. The proposed new building, which would be clearly differentiated from the historic building, would be higher than the adjacent second floor parapet but lower than the front of City Hall and its cupola.  Analysis of Potential Historic Resource ImpactsHistoric Resources Group (HRG) prepared a Historic Resources Technical Report (Appendix A of Attachment E) assessing the proposed project for consistency with each of the Secretary of the Interiors Standards for Rehabilitation (the Standards). In analyzing the proposed demolition and modifications to City Hall, HRG examined whether these alterations would result in new impacts to a historic resource that the CCSP EIR did not consider and would substantially reduce the integrity or significance of the resource. To make this determination, the proposed alterations were reviewed in the context of several relevant Preservation Briefs and for consistency with the Standards. Each proposed alteration is described and analyzed to determine whether it might impact the stability or integrity of the historic structure or parcel. The report also looked at whether the alterations taken together might cause the resource to lose its eligibility as a State or National historic landmark.  HRGs conclusion that the proposed demolition will not substantially reduce the integrity or significance of important resources on the site or in the vicinity is based on the determination that the original building components proposed for removal are located in the rear of the building, are not the most important character-defining features and that their removal will leave the majority of character-defining spaces and features of City Hall substantially intact. For these reasons, after removal of these two components, City Hall will retain sufficient integrity to convey its historic significance and remain eligible for listing on the California State Register and the National Register of Historic Places. The HRG study also concluded that the overall setting of City Hall would not be substantially altered by the project and that the overall historic integrity of City Hall will be retained The majority of the character defining features of the City Hall property will remain intact and will continue to convey their historic significance. The proposed new construction was also reviewed to determine if it would result in cultural resource impacts that would be substantially greater than those analyzed in the CCSP EIR. Analysis of the new building includes the relationship of the addition to the primary, Landmark building, and its effect on the historic courtyard of City Hall, which was returned in 2005 to a state more closely resembling the period of significance. The courtyard will transform from a 3-sided landscaped area of 8,000 square feet to a 4-sided (enclosed) area of 6,500 square feet. The current landscaping, designed to evoke the original circular driveway behind City Hall, is not original or character-defining. In consideration of the full historic resource analysis, the CCSP EIR addendum concludes that the project would not result in new impacts that would be substantially greater than those analyzed in the CCSP EIR. Planning Commission Action and AppealOn November 2, 2016, the Planning Commission held a public hearing and considered the Development Review Permit (DRP) application for the proposed City Services Building and a recommendation to amend the CCSP. At the Planning Commission hearing, concerns were expressed regarding the projects impact on the historic setting of City Hall. The Commission was particularly concerned with views of City Halls primary faade that would be impacted by the proposed solar port structure in the north parking lot, which would supply some of the solar energy necessary to achieve a net zero energy building. The hearing was continued to November 16, 2016, to allow time for the applicant to evaluate potential project revisions including reducing the size of the solar carport and pulling it back from Main Street to retain the view of City Hall from the Main Street Bridge, and minimizing the amount of equipment in the north parking lot. The applicant was also asked to provide clarification to the Commission on certain components of the project including views from Olympic Drive and other alternatives for the equipment and solar panels that were considered.  After additional testimony and presentation by representatives of the Public Works Department (the applicant) and members of the public, the Planning Commission approved the DRP by a vote of 4-2, with one abstention. The Planning Commission also adopted a resolution recommending that the Council amend the Civic Center Specific Plan (CCSP) in order to change the project location within the City Hall site and increase its height, along with an addendum to the CCSP Environmental Impact Report. The specific plan amendment request is being forwarded to Council as a separate hearing item on this agenda. On November 29, 2016, the Planning Commissions approval of Development Review Permit 16ENT-0140 was appealed in a timely manner by David Garden. The appeal statement (Attachment C) contains seven points on which the appellant has challenged the Commissions decision. A full description and analysis of the project are included in the November 2, 2016 Planning Commission report (Attachment D).  ", "summary": "On November 16, 2016, the Planning Commission approved Development Review Permit (DRP) 16ENT-0140 for a three-story, 50,200 square-foot, 45-foot high rear extension to Santa Monica City Hall. The approved plans included revisions proposed by the applicant in response to Commissioner, public and staff concerns. These revisions include reconfigured solar panel locations; a reduced free-standing solar port in the north parking lot; and relocated bike lockers, parking and loading spaces, and trash receptacle area. The Commissions decision, findings, and conditions of approval are set forth in a Statement of Official Action (Attachment B).  The Planning Commissions decision was appealed on November 29, 2016 by David Garden. The appellant states that the application should be delayed for reasons related to design, public health, and Municipal Code requirements (Attachment C). This report summarizes the Planning Commissions action, the points of each appeal provided by the appellant, and staffs analysis. This report concludes with a recommendation from staff to uphold the Planning Commissions approval of the Development Review Permit based upon the findings and subject to the conditions adopted by the Planning Commission on November 16, 2016, except for the removal of Condition #6. The Planning Commission also adopted a resolution recommending that the Council amend the Civic Center Specific Plan (CCSP) in order to change the project location within the City Hall site and increase its height, along with an addendum to the CCSP Environmental Impact Report.

Ordinances", "body": {"other": "On August 31, 2016, the City of Santa Monica Public Works Department submitted an application to amend the Civic Center Specific Plan in conjunction with Development Review Permit (DRP) 16ENT-0140 for a three-story, 50,200 square-foot, 45-feet high extension to the east of Santa Monica City Hall located at 1685 Main Street. The project, known as the City Services Building (CSB), would create an enclosed courtyard with City Hall, with its rear elevation facing Avenida Mazatlan and the Public Safety Building.   The CSB project requires an amendment to the Civic Center Specific Plan (CCSP), because the CCSP currently specifies that a 40,000 square-foot structure with an 84-foot tower should be built in a different location to accommodate the need for additional government office space. The proposed amendment would allow a building addition up to 55,000 square feet in size and 45 feet in height at the rear of City Hall. The small amount of additional building area beyond the amount requested in the project would provide a small amount of flexibility within the scope of the specific plan. The Plan would require parking for City Hall and the CSB to be provided in the Civic Center parking structure and lot.  Project analysis includes special consideration of the historic context of the City-designated Landmark City Hall building and parcel.  On November 2, 2016, the Planning Commission held a public hearing on the CSB and the proposed CCSP amendment and continued the hearing to allow time for the applicant to evaluate potential project revisions and provide clarification to the Commission on certain components of the project. On November 16, 2016, the Planning Commission voted 4-2, with one abstention, to approve the Development Review Permit and adopted a resolution recommending amendment of the CCSP to accommodate the project.  In recommending the CCSP amendment, the Planning Commission also considered an addendum to the CCSP Environmental Impact Report along with the 2005 CCSP EIR.  The addendum preparation involved review of the full CEQA checklist required by the California Environmental Quality Act, with a particular emphasis on consideration of potential impacts on Cultural Resources. The addendum analysis concluded that the proposed modifications would not reduce the significance of City Hall as a historic resource and would not generate new significant environmental impacts or a substantial increase in the severity of impacts previously identified in the 2005 CCSP EIR.  A draft resolution to amend the CCSP is provided as Attachment A to this report. Planning Commission Action On November 2, 2016, the Planning Commission held a public hearing and considered the Development Review Permit (DRP) application for the proposed City Services Building and the recommended amendments to the CCSP. Following extensive discussion, the hearing was continued to November 16, 2016 to allow time for the applicant to evaluate potential project revisions that would minimize the visual impact of the proposed solar structure and reduce the amount of equipment proposed in the north parking lot. The Commission also requested clarifications on certain components of the project, particularly views from Olympic Drive and whether alternative locations for the equipment and solar panels were considered.  After further testimony and presentation by representatives of the Public Works Department (the applicant), and additional public comment, the Planning Commission recommended that the Council amend the CCSP and approved the DRP by a vote of 4-2, with one abstention The resolution recommending a CCSP amendment is provided as Attachment B to this report.   An appeal of the Planning Commissions action to approve the DRP was filed on November 29, 2016, and is scheduled for Councils consideration independently from this action. Previous Related Council ActionThe City Services Building project has been developed based on Council discussion and direction, including the following specific actions:           October 13, 2007 - Staff presented a City office space needs analysis to Council at a special meeting, which included five alternatives. Council expressed a preference for the option of an enhanced Civic Center.           July 8, 2008 - Council endorsed the short term strategies identified in a February 11, 2008, Information Item. Strategies included reducing leases and moving staff closer to City Hall, developing office space in the former jail wing and on Fourth Street within the Civic Center Parking Structure.          September 16, 2008 - Council approved a contract with Gensler Architects, Inc. to complete a space needs analysis for City administrative space as an update to the April 2002 Sares Regis Group of Northern Californias feasibility study. The completed analysis report recommended the following:                 A one stop shop model for public counter functions.               Optimizing the effective use of the historic City Hall building.               Implementing specific departmental office space designs to support and enhance the variety of work processes required within the Citys administrative functions.               Constructing an administrative services building on the City Hall campus.          March 27, 2012 - Council authorized staff to seek proposals for initial design and cost estimates for a City Services Building located on the site east of City Hall after considering alternative sites, including the north slope site originally contemplated in the CCSP. Council expressed preference for the site east of City Hall over the north slope site because the north slope site has development constraints due to the adjacent freeway, and would be non-contiguous to City Hall.  April 8, 2014 - Council authorized staff to execute an agreement with design-build contractor Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company (including design firm Frederick Fisher and Partners Architects), for initial design, cost estimation services, and feasibility analysis for the City Services Building in an amount not to exceed $258,500.  January 27, 2015 - Council reviewed and provided comments on the feasibility analysis, concept design and financial options for the City Services Building and authorized the design phase for an approximately 50,000 square foot building, with three stories above grade and a basement level. Additionally, Council requested that the project team move forward with the design of the facility and endeavor to meet the Living Building Challenge, internationally the most rigorous and ambitious environmental performance standard for buildings (more information can be found at <http://living-future.org/>). The overall project cost for this option was estimated to be $56,385,130, not including previous allocations for the feasibility phase.  April 28, 2015 - Council authorized the City Manager to execute a contract with Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company for design services for the City Services Building for a Guaranteed Maximum Price of $7,064,501 and to authorize direct owners costs associated with the design phase in the amount of $540,000.   May 24, 2016 - The schematic design and cost estimates for the City Services Building were presented to Council, along with information that achievement of the Living Building Challenge would cost more than $74,566,000 rather than the initially estimated $56 million. Financing options were presented and after discussion, Council authorized the Public Works Department to proceed with design development of the project. A full description and analysis of the project are included in the November 2, 2016 Planning Commission report (Attachment E). An abbreviated summary of the project is provided below for context followed by discussion of the proposed CCSP amendment.   Project Site and DescriptionThe proposed amendment is to allow a project located east of City Hall on the City Hall parcel at 1685 Main Street, which currently contains three buildings: City Hall, the Public Safety Facility (PSF) and the Civic Center Parking Garage.  Between City Hall and the PSF is a three-sided courtyard of approximately 8,000 square feet that opens toward a service road (Avenida Mazatlan). The courtyard includes landscaping (installed as temporary in 2005), picnic benches, bike parking and a semi-circular walkway that pays homage to the original road behind City Hall. Also on the site to the north of City Hall is a 30-space surface parking lot, mechanical equipment, and refuse/recycling bins. The I-10 freeway borders the property on the north.   Aerial View and Map of Site LocationZoning District:CCLand Use Element Designation:Institutional/Public LandsParcel Area:7.36 acresExisting On-Site Improvements (Year Built):City Hall (1939), Public Safety Building (2003), Ken Genser Square (2014)Adjacent Land Uses:Tongva Park; County CourthouseHistoric Resource InventoryDesignated City Landmark (1979) The City Services Building (CSB) would add a three-story plus basement (45), 50,200 square-foot addition to the rear of the 1939 Moderne Style City Hall Building, along Avenida Mazatlan, situated on some of the eastern portion of the City Hall courtyard to create a 6,700 square-foot, four-sided interior courtyard (Figure 3). Although it will appear to be part of the building, the CSB is being designed as a structurally separate building. Other accessory structures proposed on the site include a carport in the North Parking supporting solar panels for the CSB and equipment enclosures located near the northern edge of the property. The CCSP & Civic Core Special Use DistrictThe CCSP (Attachment D) was first adopted in 1993, revised substantially in June 2005 and last amended in October 2015. The CCSPs Civic Core Special Use District is comprised of City Hall, the Public Safety Building, the Civic Center Parking Structure, and the County Courthouse and Tongva Park. The CCSP envisioned a cohesive governmental concentration in this district, enhanced by open space and entertainment uses to bring the community together. The Civic Core is also the most important subarea for achieving the Plans goal to connect the Civic Center with the beach and Downtown.  The Civic Centers centrality and connectivity have been significantly boosted as key CCSP projects have been constructed including: pathways through Tongva Park, the Olympic Drive extension between Ocean Avenue and Fourth Street, vehicular and pedestrian roads through RAND and the Village, and the Main Street-2nd Street alignment over Colorado Avenue. Building Out the CCSP In addition to the Civic Core projects that the City has built to implement the CCSP, the relocation of RAND Corporation headquarters and development of housing units with restaurants and cafes at the Village at Santa Monica project have transformed the Civic Center and significantly changed its dynamic. Regular users of the Civic Center area have diversified, with an increase in the areas activity level and hours of active use. Another important community need will be met when Santa Monica College constructs its planned Early Childhood Education Center (recently renamed as the Early Childhood Lab School) over the next two years.  In terms of specific development regulations, CCSP policies limit height and total building area, but do not specify setbacks, floor-area ratio (FAR) or parking requirements. Each individual Civic Center project that has been implemented has been guided by the strong urban design concept contained in the CCSP. However, in most cases by the time projects are fully designed, they have been at odds with some of the CCSPs more specific requirements, which were established without full benefit of the level of analysis undertaken in the project design process. Because of this, most of the projects in the CCSP area, like the CSB, have necessitated specific plan amendments.  The City Services Building in the CCSPAlthough the City began planning the City Services Building within the last couple of years, the need to provide more space for City operations has long been understood, and the 1993 CCSP included the building in concept. The building, envisioned north of City Hall, was contemplated with a maximum size of 40,000 square feet, and a general height of 45 feet, with an 84-foot tower. Since that time, the number of employees working in rented office space has grown substantially. The current assessment estimates the need for 25% more office space and an integrated City Hall public counter. The Citys architects and engineers considered many options and concluded that the current CCSP location for the CSB was not optimal for a number of reasons, including impacting the views of historic City Hall from the Main Street Bridge and the lack of space to accommodate the 50,000 square feet required for the consolidation of staff and operations. The proposed CCSP amendment would permit up to 55,000 square feet, to allow some flexibility without need to amend the CCSP again. The maximum height of 45 feet would remain the same, but the 84-foot tower would be eliminated.  This will also address concerns that the Citys Landmarks Commission and other community preservation advocates have expressed for over a decade about the impact that placing a building between the Main Street Bridge and City Hall with an 84 tower element would have on the view of City Hall from the Main Street Bridge. At a May 2005 meeting, the Landmarks Commission expressed these concerns as they considered other alterations to City Hall. Proposed CCSP Amendment LanguageTo amend the specific plan for the CSB project, figures and descriptions of the City services building and Civic Core Special Use District would be revised to remove references to the separate building along Main Street and to show instead a rear addition to City Hall as described above. The development parameters for the size and height of the City Services Building would be adjusted. The amendment would clarify that drivers to City Hall will have parking provided in the shared Civic Center public parking structure and surface lot and that bicycle parking must be provided as required by the Zoning Ordinance but with some flexibility in regard to its placement on the site.  The existing parking lot north of City Hall, currently restricted to specifically-assigned users, would close during construction of the CSB. Following the construction period, it is anticipated that it may be repurposed or redesigned either for parking or other public purposes. The proposed CCSP language is flexible to allow inclusion of no parking, less parking or restoration of the same amount of parking as currently provided. Access around the building on Fujinomiya Douri will continue to be provided.  The future configuration of this area will be determined at a later date under separate permit.  The proposed amendments are included in the draft Council resolution (Attachment A). General Plan Consistency The vision for the Civic Center is discussed in the General Plan Land Use & Circulation Element, (LUCE, page 2.6-19), which emphasizes improved connectivity between the Civic Center, Downtown and Oceanfront Districts. The LUCE calls for updating the CCSP to reflect the emergence of the district as an open space link with the surrounding area. The proposed relocation of the CSB to the rear of City Hall supports the LUCE open space concept while providing more needed office space for City staff.   The General Plan Historic Preservation Element (HPE) Objective 4.5 calls for City policies to Protect historic views and landscapes. The proposed project is consistent with this HPE Objective in that adding the additional space to the rear of City Hall assures the primacy of the historic building on Main Street by maintaining the openness and views between the Main Street Bridge and City Hall.  Environmental ReviewAn Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was prepared for the Civic Center Specific Plan (CCSP) project in accordance with Section 15087 of the State CEQA Guidelines. The CCSP EIR, certified on June 28, 2005, analyzed the development of a mix of future land uses as well as circulation improvements in the Civic Center Specific Plan area. The CCSP EIR included the analysis of a potential City Services Building up to 100,000 sf and 56 feet in height on Fujinomiya Douri, north of City Hall. Subsequent to certification of the EIR, five addenda were prepared and published to address changes in the Civic Center Specific Plan. Per Section 15164 of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) guidelines, an Addendum to a certified EIR is required if minor technical changes or minor modifications to the proposed project occur. Preparation of an addendum is appropriate unless subsequent changes proposed in the project or changed circumstances will result in new significant impacts or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant impacts will occur.  To determine whether the proposed alterations to the CSB would have new or more severe significant environmental impacts that were not previously analyzed in the CCSP EIR and the five addenda, a Sixth Addendum to the CCSP EIR (Attachment C) was prepared for the proposed project. All potential areas of impact were studied, with particular discussion on some including Historic Preservation, Traffic and Circulation, and Construction Effects. This included a technical report prepared by Historic Resources Group that fully analyzed the potential historic resource impacts of amending the CCSP to move the CSBs location to the rear of the Landmark City Hall building, including demolition of some components of the existing building (see Appendix A of Attachment C).  As analyzed in the Addendum, the proposed project retains the overall historic integrity of City Hall to continue to convey its historic significance, and the proposed modifications to the CCSP would not generate new significant environmental impacts or a substantial increase in the severity of previously significant impacts identified in the 2005 Civic Center Specific Plan EIR.  Therefore, pursuant to CEQA, preparation of a subsequent or supplemental EIR is not required. Public OutreachPublic notice for the November 2, 2016 Planning Commission hearing (and its continuance to November 16, 2016) and for this Council hearing was provided as required by the Zoning Code. Notices were mailed to surrounding properties within 1000 feet of the project site and an advertisement was placed in the Santa Monica Daily Press. Two notices, one on each street frontage of City Hall, were posted as required prior to each public hearing. AlternativesAs an alternative to the staff recommendation, the Council may choose to:         Deny the proposed CCSP Amendment, maintaining the Main Street location as the planned location for a City Services Building;         Modify the proposed CCSP Amendment to adjust the standards or location of the City Services Building  "}, "title": " Amendments to the Civic Center Specific Plan to Accommodate the City Services Building at the Rear of Santa Monica City Hall", "Sponsors": null, "recommendations": [""], "Department": "Design & Preservation (PCD)"}], [{"Category": "08. Administrative Item", "body": {"other": "As a result of the utilization of the Master Plan during the past five years, staff and the Task Force have identified necessary revisions to its content and vision. These revisions evolve the Master Plan to take account of climate change, maximize its effectiveness and sustainability while supporting a positive partnership of collaboration on the care of the Citys urban forest. Staff presented an overview of the changes, focusing primarily on species selection and planting prioritization, to the following 11 boards, commissions, appointed bodies and neighborhood groups for their input before the Task Force meeting on November 16, 2016:  Planning Commission Landmarks Commission  Recreation and Parks Commission Task Force on the Environment  Water Advisory Committee Architectural Review Board Friends of Sunset Park  North of Montana Association Ocean Park Association Santa Monica Mid-City Neighbors Wilshire Montana Neighborhood Coalition All boards, commissions, appointed bodies and neighborhood groups were supportive of the proposed revisions. The primary concern was that significant streets within the City do not lose their character. This would be addressed by creating individual planting plans for these streets by the Species Subcommittee of the Task Force. Additionally, greater tree care education was requested to preserve the urban forest, particularly during the drought. Therefore, greater educational outreach would be developed in addition to planting more species that require minimal additional irrigation.The proposed revisions are summarized into the three categories of new information, clarification of existing information, and grammar and punctuation corrections and were unanimously approved by the Urban Forest Task Force at its November 16, 2016 public meeting.  New InformationThe following information would be added to Chapter Two - Guiding Principles of the Master Plan: Inclusion of the legal protection of the citys trees through the Santa Monicas Municipal Code (SMMC 7.40 Tree Code).  Notification requirement for removals for all public trees, not just street trees. Young trees under five-inch diameter at breast height (DBH) would not require notification. Younger trees typically have a higher mortality rate during the establishment phase of 24 months. Adding this would enable staff to quickly replace those trees that may die.  Industry recognized tree valuation protocol from the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers. This valuation protocol is currently used and its inclusion in the Master Plan is appropriate to ensure transparency and awareness of this practice. This protocol ensures tree canopy is not adversely impacted by the loss of healthy public trees when they need to be removed due to construction projects, traffic accidents, and other events by planting new trees. The number of replacement trees planted is based on the species, size and condition of the tree removed. Currently, tree valuation is not included in the Master Plan. Language prohibiting the disruption of wildlife during tree care operations. Language to allow staff to update text in the appendices throughout the document with the approval of the Task Force. The appendices of the Master Plan are the tree care guidelines and species designations. Therefore, this would allow for the timely updating of this key information because it affects day-to-day urban forest operations. As of now, even minor operational changes to the Master Plan would need Council approval. Language to expand the appeal process. Currently, the public can only appeal the Citys decision to remove a tree. Staff proposes to add language that would allow the public to appeal the Citys decision to not remove a public tree. In both instances appeals would be heard by the Task Force. Criteria added to define species selection and planting prioritization for street trees. Clarification of Existing Information - Chapter TwoBelow is a table that describes the current language and proposed updates to the Guiding Principles section of the Urban Forest Master Plan (Chapter Two): Broad language describing the goal of the Citys urban forest providing environmental benefits to the community.Definition of sustainable forest management and sustainable urban forest management metrics. Heritage Tree program was identified as a potential strategy to increase public understanding of the urban forest. Heritage Tree program has since been operationalized and launched. Broad language stating the City will follow best management practices and industry standards, but these are not defined in the current master plan.Precise industry standards and best management practices would be defined for tree pruning, planting, risk management and preservation during construction. Canopy priority listed as a strategy for enhancing the urban forest but without clear strategic goals defined.Add street tree planting prioritization based on urban forest metrics, environmental need and human need. Tree removal criteria found in the appendices and only includes street trees, not all public trees. Tree removal criteria moved from the appendices to the Guiding Principles section due to its importance and expanded to include all public trees. Number of days for the public notification of street tree removals is currently 14 business days. Other public trees do not require public notification. Reduce public notification from 14 to 10 business days to streamline the process. This would apply to all public tree removals, not only street trees. Increasing the Citys tree canopy cover identified as a strategy but with no specified goal. The goal for increasing urban tree canopy (UTC) over public property would be a 5% increase over 10 years. Current single species will not exceed 10% of the public tree population.Increase the species diversity goal to a maximum of 5% for any one species and add that any family (genus) would not exceed 10%. This would add far greater environmental resilience to the urban forest by limiting the over-planting of species.  Clarification of Existing Information - Species Designations in the AppendicesAfter an extensive review of the current street tree planting program, staff worked with the Task Forces species subcommittee to modify this section for the reasons below: Increase use of drought resilient species. Replace poorly performing species or those not available from nurseries with those that would thrive better based on site conditions. Improved and systematic matching of species based on growing space size and surrounding conditions such as overhead wires. This would reduce the use of larger species, such as Ficus, on narrow parkways. These changes would ultimately improve the sustainability and function of the urban forest while meeting the species diversity goal. Grammar and PunctuationMinor grammar and punctuation edits would be made throughout the document. ", "background": "On April 7, 2009 (Attachment A), Council approved the establishment of the Urban Forest Task Force to advise staff on the development of a long-range urban forest master plan, review specific urban forest issues, and serve in an advisory capacity to City Council until completion of the Master Plan. On September 22, 2009 (Attachment B), Council appointed the seven-member Task Force to advise staff through the completion of the Master Plan, and on April 10, 2012 (Attachment C), Council reconstituted an Urban Forest Task Force for seven years as an advisory body to support the implementation of the Urban Forest Master Plan. On December 13, 2011 (Attachment D), Council adopted the Proposed City of Santa Monica Urban Forest Master Plan, which also includes a Street Tree Designations List to replace street trees by street segment under strict removal criteria.  The Master Plan is the result of over two years of community input, research and planning by the Council appointed Urban Forest Task Force. The process involved extensive public input through surveys, community workshops and regular and special meetings of the Task Force. The Master Plan is an adaptive document that acknowledges the needs of the urban forest and will fluctuate over time. Therefore, the proposed revisions are part of a process to evolve the Master Plan so it continues to deliver strategic vision and guidance on the management and governance of the Citys urban forest.  ", "summary": "The Urban Forest Master Plan (Master Plan) serves as a guide for perpetuating, managing and enhancing Santa Monicas urban forest.

Administrative Item", "body": {"other": "Economic UpdateThe national economy continues to show strength. The economic growth of 3.5% in the third quarter was the highest quarterly increase in two years. Most economists are projecting growth in the 2.5% range annually over the 2017-2018 time period. Unemployment is at its lowest level in eight years. Inflation, while showing some signs of increase, is expected to remain relatively low through at least 2018. The housing market also continues to exhibit strength that is expected to continue for at least the next two years. The Federal Reserve increased interest rates in December for the first time in a year, and has indicated that two to four additional increases are anticipated in 2017. The economy is not without risks, however. The current period of expansion is one of the longest without a recession on record, the world economy is showing signs of strain and the new presidential administration also creates uncertainty. The State economy recovered strongly from the Great Recession. Growth in household incomes is exceeding the national average. However, during that time, the State budget has also expanded in an attempt to correct long term issues. However, after several years of strong growth, State revenues are beginning to fall short of projections. According to the Governors FY 2017-18 Proposed Budget, an operating deficit of nearly $2 billion will occur next fiscal year with on-going deficits in the same range in the future unless corrective action is taken. While the budget does propose corrective actions, the possibility of a recession in the next few years poses additional significant risks to the State Budget.  Santa Monicas economy remains relatively strong due in large part to its geographic location and its diversified tax revenue base. Revenue will be helped by the opening of three new hotels over the next several years. However, there are signs of moderation in the local economys growth rate. Also, as with the State and national economies, the threat of a recession could significantly alter revenue projections.  More information on some of the Citys key revenue sources is provided below.   Property values in the City remain the third highest in Los Angeles County for a City with the 19th largest population.  The FY 2016-17 assessed value increase was 6.5% after a 6% gain the previous year. Moderate increases of 3-4% are projected over the five-year forecast period. Sales Tax receipts are expected to moderate due to sluggish growth in regional household income, a national shift from buying goods to purchasing services and the growth of online purchases. Projected annual growth is 3-3.5% for the first two years of the forecast before falling to less than 3% annually for the remainder of the forecast period.  Tourism, which provides a major stimulus to the local economy by creating jobs and producing revenues, continues to exhibit strength. Transient Occupancy Taxes have increased at an average annual rate of 9.3% over the last six years, and revenues are expected to continue having healthy increases over the forecast period, primarily reflecting the addition of three new hotels during the forecast. One area of uncertainty over the forecast period is the impact of new registration requirements for home share hosting platforms. Business License Taxes are expected to show some weakness in FY 2016-17 and FY 2017-18, reflecting the loss of several of the largest taxpayers due to relocations, before resuming a moderate growth rate of just under 3% for the remainder of the forecast period. Utility Users Tax revenues are relatively flat over the forecast period as revenues from telecommunication services continue to drop. Parking Facility Taxes are expected to grow by approximately 2% per year over the forecast period. And interest rates, which fell to historically low levels over the last seven years, significantly impacting the Citys investment income, have begun to increase. While a gradual increase is expected over the forecast period, rates are still expected to remain at relatively low levels.  General Fund Five-Year Financial Forecast Projected Fund BalanceStaff has completed three forecast scenarios that contemplate Best, Probable, and Worst Case impacts on the General Fund. The chart below shows the three forecast scenarios.  The Probable scenario, which serves as the baseline for the forecast, shows the General Fund experiencing a potential shortfall of $0.2 million in FY 2017-18, that increases to $16.4 million in FY 2021-22. This scenario is most impacted by new developments in the cost of retirement contributions and workers compensation costs, which are discussed below. As in the past, health care costs also play a large role in increasing costs of operations. In the Best Case scenario, bolstered by higher increases in revenues, the General Fund fiscal condition would be positive throughout the forecast period. In the Worst Case scenario, which shows the effects of a possible recession, the General Fund would experience a shortfall of $7.9 million in FY 2017-18 that would increase significantly to $25.1 million in FY 2021-22. AssumptionsFactors in all scenarios include midyear changes as noted below, as well as the following assumptions: Revenue Growth AssumptionsGeneral Fund revenues are projected to increase by an average of 3.6% annually over the next five years. However, a significant portion of the growth relates to the three new hotels set to open during the period as well as the transaction and use tax increase approved by voters in November 2016 (Measure GSH), which is anticipated to be used for affordable housing and education purposes. Removing the impact of these items, the projected baseline growth rate is closer to 2.6% annually. The baseline forecast assumes no recession during the forecast period. In the Best Case scenario, revenues would grow at a slightly higher rate approximating a 1% increase. In the Worst Case scenario, showing the potential effects of a recession, revenues would experience a 2% decrease.  Expenditure Growth AssumptionsAll scenarios assume cost increases at the anticipated rate of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is anticipated to be 2.2% in FY 2017-18 and 2.4% in FYs 2018-22. The overall rate of growth for expenditures is 4.7%. Almost three-quarters of the General Fund operating budget is composed of labor costs, and a number of these costs, including retirement, health insurance and workers compensation, increase at a rate that is higher than the CPI and represent significant budgetary challenges in the years to come. As in past years where the forecast shows an upcoming structural deficit, staff will work as part of the Biennial Budget process to realign spending in order ensure that the Citys FY 2017-19 budget provides a financially sustainable plan.  Retirement CostsThe cost of pension contributions represents an ever-increasing share of local government costs, and the City has taken actions over the past several years to counteract these increases. Among these actions has been an increase in the amount that employees are required to pay towards their future benefits. At this time, Miscellaneous employees contribute up to 30% of the total contribution rate towards the cost of their retirement benefits, while Police Officers Association employees contribute up to 20% and Firefighters Local 1109 IAFF employees contribute up to 29%. Also, the City has used savings to pay down $31.4 million of its unfunded liability, and follows a policy to pay down approximately $1.3 million of its unfunded liability each year. These payments lower the Citys annual contribution costs over time. In addition, the City takes advantage of a program offered by CalPERS that allows cities prepaying a portion of their total contribution at the beginning of the fiscal year to receive a discount on the amount owed. The net savings to the City of these discounts has been approximately $10.6 million through the current fiscal year.Despite these measures, the cost of retirement continues to rise. In December 2016, the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) announced that it would lower its investment portfolio growth assumptions from 7.5% to 7.0% over three years. For public agencies like the City of Santa Monica, the new discount rate of 7.375% would take effect July 1, 2018. The discount rate would decrease to 7.25% effective July 1, 2019 and 7.0% effective July 1, 2020. Based on information from CalPERS, staff estimates that the adjustment would result in an additional increase of $1.8 million to General Fund retirement costs in FY 2018-19, increasing to $12.6 million in FY 2021‑22. This change has had a severe impact on the five year projections. The Citys unfunded pension liability of $387 million, along with the ratcheting down of investment earning projections, represents the most serious long-term threat to fiscal sustainability, not just in Santa Monica, but for public agencies in California. It will require the City to make adjustments, including realigning staffing needs by examining the need for positions that have been vacant for long periods of time, and seeking additional employee cost sharing contributions during future labor negotiations. Workers Compensation CostsUnder the Probable Case scenario, workers compensation costs are anticipated to increase by 10% beginning in FY 2017-18. This increase represents another severe and unanticipated impact on the Citys operating expenses as previous forecasts projected a 5% annual rate of increase. The change is due to continued increases in the number of claims filed and higher permanent and temporary disability expenses. These increases are due to the Citys aging workforce and increases in State-mandated permanent disability rates. The City continues to implement programs to contain workers compensation costs, yet these projects will take some years to yield results. An Information Item published on December 12, 2016 discusses these programs. The actuarial study conducted for the Citywide Workers Compensation Self-Insurance Fund for FY 2017-18 shows that the City will need to increase its contribution from $13.4 million to $20.5 million to maintain a responsible funding level to cover prior and current claims. The General Fund is responsible for absorbing roughly half of the $7.1 million increase, and the balance will be apportioned amongst the Citys non-General Funds. The forecast includes $7.2 million from FY 2014-15 savings reserved in the General Fund fund balance to offset increased workers compensation costs over four years ($1.8 million a year) starting in FY 2015‑16. The impact of the costs with no offset is reflected beginning in FY 2019-20. Healthcare CostsUnder the Probable Case scenario, healthcare costs for employees are anticipated to increase by 7.8-9% in FY 2017-18 depending on the healthcare plans used by employees. While the rate of increase continues to exceed Consumer Price Index changes, the projected annual growth rates of healthcare costs have held relatively steady over the past 5 years of the forecast. Staff has eliminated the Cadillac Tax associated with the Affordable Care Act pending anticipated legislative changes impacting the Act. Pension costs, workers comp costs and healthcare costs are all directly related to the Citys long-standing policies of providing a broad range of high-quality services using City personnel. In the future, choices will need to be made about how to achieve community outcomes in ways that are fiscally sustainable. The next two-year budget cycle represents the opportunity to begin this shift in ways that minimize disruption and provide the maximum opportunity to continue to improve the efficiency of services without continuing to expand the size of City staff. Other FundsOther major funds included in the Five-Year Financial Forecast fall into two categories: 1) funds that operate with sufficient revenues to sustain necessary operating and capital needs; and 2) funds that have a structural deficit where ongoing revenues are not sufficient to cover ongoing expenditures. Self-Sustaining Enterprise FundsEnterprise funds that historically rely on sufficient revenues to support necessary operations include the Water, Wastewater, Resource Recovery and Recycling (RRR) and Big Blue Bus (BBB) funds. The Water and Wastewater Funds have sufficient revenues to cover current operations, due to rate increases in Water Fund that will allow the implementation of the Sustainable Water Master Plan while also maintaining reserve levels. The Wastewater Fund continues to have adequate revenues and reserves to meet current operational and capital expenditures. The Resource Recovery and Recycling (RRR) Fund will maintain a positive fund balance until FY 2019-20 as expenditure projections continue to outpace revenues. There are several upcoming proposals that may potentially have a substantial impact on the financial stability of the fund, including the piloting of a residential wet/dry collection system, expanding the commercial rot or not program, the Funds share of costs to complete the Corporate Yards project, and the displacement of the recycling contractor at the Corporate Yards that will result in additional costs for transporting the City-collected recycling material to an offsite location. Staff will continue to monitor fund performance and consider the need for a rate increase in the future. The BBB Fund will maintain a positive fund balance over the next five years. While expenditures continue to rise, BBB, like most transit agencies in the country, continues to be confronted with reduced ridership. BBB staff continues to develop strategies to improve ridership. The additional revenue from the voter-approved Measure M, which allocates an additional  cent sales tax to transportation agencies in order to improve traffic congestion, keep fares affordable and improve bus systems, will help offset the reduction in farebox revenue, the reduction of more than 1/3 of the annual revenue that BBB historically receives from the State Transit Assistance (STA) program due to the reduction in diesel fuel sales in the State, and the increase in operating costs associated with new service and new programs to offset Workers Compensation and liability costs. BBB will continue to monitor the fund balance as these funds are additionally used to fund BBBs capital improvement plan. The Beach Fund will also generate adequate revenues to sustain their operations throughout the next five years. With the implementation of the green burial program, the Cemetery Fund will maintain a positive fund balance over the next five years. With the new Airport City Owned Fixed Based Operation (FBO), the Airport Fund is currently showing a shortfall as early as FY 2017-18 pending the completion of staff work to establish FBO revenue projections. Additional revenues from the elimination of Master Leases and the escalation of rental rates to match market conditions are anticipated to contribute additional revenues to the fund. If additional revenue targets are not met, capital improvement projects will need to be evaluated to ensure self-sufficiency of the fund. Necessary adjustments will be made during the budget process to insure that the fund will have a positive balance in FY 2017-18. Staff projects the Pier Fund to be self-sustaining through the end of FY 2016-17. Capital needs that are unable to be funded by the Pier Fund during the forecast period must compete with capital needs addressed through the General Fund. Funds Requiring General Fund SubsidiesThe Housing Authority Fund has a projected operating structural deficit of $600,000 - $850,000 annually throughout the forecast period. This assumes a continuation of the current funding levels and that HUD funding to the housing authorities will not be reduced. Midyear Budget AdjustmentsAt midyear, staff recommends revenue budget changes based on actual performance and new information, and proposes adjustments to the expenditure budget as necessary to most effectively maintain operations. Revenue Adjustments  General FundThe FY 2016-17 Midyear Review includes a number of recommended revenue adjustments, resulting in a net increase of $5.5 million. However, only $2.1 million of the increase is expected to be on-going. Significant increases include:          $3.6 million in property taxes         $1.8 million in Documentary Transfer Taxes         $1.8 million in Transaction and Use taxes from Measure GSH         $1.2 million in Transient Occupancy Taxes         $1.5 million from various miscellaneous fees and parking revenues          $0.8 million in indirect overhead charges to other fundsPartially offsetting the increases are decreases in Utility Users Taxes (-$2.0 million); Sales Taxes (-$1.3 million); Investment Income (-$1.2 million); and Parking Facility Taxes (-$0.7 million).  Revenue Adjustments  Other FundsA full listing of revenue adjustments is included in Attachment A. Significant revenue adjustments in other funds include:         Special Revenue Source (04) Fund - decrease of $2.0 million primarily due to timing changes in developer agreement payments.           Water (25) Fund  increase of $1.2 million primarily from water sales due to increased water usage as the State eased mandatory conservation restrictions, and an increase in meter service installations.           Wastewater (31) Fund  increase of $1.2 million primarily due to increase in sewer service charges due to increased water usage.           Airport (33) Fund - decrease of $1.5 million due to an adjustment in the calculation of new land leases.           Stormwater Management (34) Fund  increase of $1.2 million due to an increase to Stormwater In-Lieu Fees, partially offset by a decrease in Sale of Recycled Water revenues.          Big Blue Bus (41) Fund  decrease of $3.5 million primarily due to decrease in passenger revenues as ridership patterns continue to fluctuate since the opening of Expo.  Operating Expenditure and Staffing Adjustments  General FundProposed General Fund operating expenditure appropriations total $2.9 million. Significant appropriations include:         $1.9 million to reflect the transfer of voter-approved Measure GSH funds to the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District and for the affordable housing program;         $0.1 million to reflect an increase of 2.25 FTE due to operational changes. Net changes include the addition of a 0.25 FTE Fire Equipment Specialist in the Fire Department to create a full-time position for the administration of the vehicle maintenance program, the addition of a 1.0 FTE Family Victim Advocate position in the City Attorneys Office, and the addition of 1.0 FTE Executive Administrative Assistant position in the Information Systems Department;         $0.3 million to increase the overtime budget for the Office of Emergency Management; and         $0.2 million to reflect an increase in the subsidy to the Housing Authority Fund. Operating Expenditure and Staffing Adjustments  Other FundsProposed midyear appropriations include a net $0.1 million decrease in other funds. Significant changes reflected in the request including the following:         $0.9 million to reflect the transfer of voter-approved Measure GSH funds to the Special Revenue Fund for affordable housing;         $0.2 million to reflect an increase of 1.0 FTE Senior Development Analyst in the Housing and Economic Development Department (paid using dedicated affordable housing funding in the Special Revenue Fund) to assist with the administration of housing production and preservation projects, an increase of 1.0 FTE Civil Engineer in the Water Fund to oversee water main replacement projects, and an increase of 1.0 FTE Custodian in the Pier Fund to accommodate additional workload;         Other funds will increase by $0.8 million to reimburse the General Fund for indirect costs based on the revised cost allocation plan;         The Miscellaneous Grants Fund expenditures will increase by $0.6 million to reflect two new literacy grants and adjustments to the Household Hazardous Waste Grant and Los Angeles County Prop A O&M reimbursement programs.  Capital Improvement Program Budget AdjustmentsThe Midyear changes to the FY 2016-17 Capital Improvement Program (CIP) budget are largely non-General Fund affordable housing budget appropriations and other minor changes, which result in a total net increase to the CIP budget of approximately $22.2 million. The changes do not include any major new projects, as the FY 2016-18 Biennial Capital Improvement Program was recently adopted in June 2016. Budget changes are detailed in Attachment A, and the most significant changes are summarized below.  Approximately $20.3 million in recent revenues related to affordable housing are being budgeted in various CIP accounts to be utilized for the preservation and production of affordable housing as opportunities become available. The most significant source is approximately $14.5 million in profit participation payments from the sales of Civic Center Village condos. Remaining funds include $4.7 million in repayments received from City-Redevelopment Agency loans, which Council committed to be set aside for the production and preservation of affordable housing, as well as smaller amounts of affordable housing commercial linkage fees, affordable housing production program in-lieu developer fees, and TORCA loan repayments. Other CIP budget increases include budgeting water demand mitigation fee revenues for water conservation measures; augmenting the project budget for a water systems software application to provide a mobile version for staff to use in the field; budgeting Metro grant funds to supplement bus replacement funding; and programming local return funds for BBB to complete a comprehensive post-study of the Expo Light Rail Integration and to fund bus stop improvements. In addition, sales tax Prop C local return funds will be budgeted to create peak hour dedicated bus lanes on Lincoln Boulevard, per Councils direction on November 24, 2015 (Attachment D). Budget reductions include deferring and therefore eliminating the current-year budget for 17th Street bike and pedestrian projects because the projects will be completed in FY 2018-19 when additional grant funds are available.  Acceptance of Literacy GrantsCalifornia Library Literacy Services (CLLS), a program of the California State Library, supports Californians by providing services to low literacy adults and their families through California public libraries. The Santa Monica Public Library recently received a grant of $38,000 to support its adult literacy program. These funds would help the Library address the communitys need for basic adult literacy programs by hiring a Literacy Library Program Assistant who will coordinate and train volunteer literacy coaches and purchase program supplies. Staff is requesting authorization to accept funds for this grant. Centro Latino for Literacy, a non-profit organization, provides a pre-literacy program to non-literate, Spanish speaking adults. The Santa Monica Public Library recently received a grant of $1,000 to support its Leamos (Lets Read) @ the Library project. These funds allow the Library to provide a web-based course, test vouchers and program materials to support adult learners. Staff is requesting authorization to accept funds for this grant. Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Home Investment Partnership Act (HOME) ProgramTo receive federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Home Investment Partnership Act (HOME) Program grant funds, the City must prepare and submit a Council-approved One-Year Action Plan to HUD by May 15, 2017. The Action Plan outlines how the funds will be expended and confirms that the funded activities are consistent with the Citys Five-Year Consolidated Plan adopted by Council on May 12, 2015. The City must hold two public hearings prior to the adoption of a One-Year Action Plan allocating federal CDBG and HOME Program funds. This public hearing will satisfy one of the two meeting requirements to receive public input and recommendations for the Proposed FY 2017-18 Action Plan. The City will hold another public hearing prior to the adoption of the Proposed FY 2017-18 Action Plan. Building the FY 2017-19 Biennial BudgetOver the next several months, staff will prepare the FY 2017-19 Proposed Biennial Budget, as well as the FY 2017-18 exception-based CIP Budget (this will be the second year of the FY 2016-18 Biennial CIP Budget). Staff plans to present City spending in the FY 2017-19 Biennial Budget in the context of the Civic Wellbeing Framework, which will connect how the Citys programs and projects aim to improve the experience of living in Santa Monica. The Budget will introduce a cohesive framework that brings together the elements of the wellbeing dimensions, strategic goals, and sustainability, and will lay the groundwork for performance measurement. Council will devote more time to the Civic Wellbeing Framework at its upcoming Retreat on January 28, 2017.  The Proposed Biennial Budget will be submitted to Council and available for public review prior to the Budget Study Sessions on May 23-24, 2017 at which point staff will present department budget presentations to the Council. Council will convene a public hearing on June 27, 2017 to consider, receive public comment, make revisions to, and adopt the first year and approve the second year of the Biennial Budget. Staff seeks community input on the Biennial Budget. Members of the public can provide comments for consideration during the budgeting process by sending an email to councilmtgitems@smgov.net or by giving public testimony at the May study sessions and June 27 public hearing. Boards, Commissions, and Task Forces historically make their recommendations and priorities known through written communication to the Council, and staff encourages these groups to continue this practice. ", "background": "On June 14, 2016 (Attachment D), Council adopted the FY 2016-17 Budget as the second year of the FY 2015-17 Biennial Budget; and adopted the first year and approved the second year of the FY 2016-18 Biennial Capital Improvement Program Budget. On October 25, 2016 (Attachment E), Council approved certain revisions to the FY 2016-17 Adopted Budget that adjusted expenditures and staffing. Since October, staff completed a midyear review of all revenues and expenditures and is proposing budget adjustments for programs, activities, and revenues that have changed significantly. These adjustments will align the FY 2016-17 Revised Budget with current operations. ", "summary": "The FY 2017-18 through FY 2021-22 Five-Year Financial Forecast informs the Council and community of the Citys current and projected fiscal status as the City enters the FY 2017-19 Biennial Budget preparation process. Every six months, staff updates the five-year forecast to reflect known and potential factors that will have an impact on the Citys financial position. This tool allows Council to understand the level to which revenues can adequately cover new ongoing initiatives, or, more critically, to make course corrections if necessary to avoid a shortfall. Most cities do not plan beyond the next budget year and very few have utilized as detailed a future forecast of revenues and expenses. This has been crucial in establishing and maintaining not only the Citys AAA credit rating, but avoiding crisis management through long-term planning. The forecast reflects the impact of Consumer Price Index (CPI) and labor cost increases without new programs or staffing. Staff has completed a series of best to worst case forecast scenarios to provide a range of impacts that the General Fund may be required to withstand. In the probable scenario, General Fund expenditures slightly exceed projected revenues as early as FY 2017-18 and the structural deficit reaches $16.4 million by FY 2021-22. In the best case, General Fund revenues would exceed expenditures throughout the forecast period, while the worst case shows a shortfall of approximately $7.9 million in FY 2017-18 that increases to approximately $25.1 million in FY 2021-22. To eliminate current and out-year projected shortfalls and also maintain a healthy level of General Fund reserves, staff recommends a budget strategy that seeks to rein in personnel cost growth and focus resources on the Citys Strategic Goals and key priorities. A discussion of other funds and any potential changes in their financial status is also included in this report. Generally, these funds are projected to have positive fund balances over the course of the next biennial budget period. Proposed FY 2016-17 midyear adjustments result in a $2.5 million, or a 0.3% increase over the citywide revenue budget, and expenditure adjustments result in a net $24.5 million or a 3.9%% increase over the citywide expenditure budget. This report also includes a staff recommendation to accept two literacy grants for the Santa Monica Public Library. Finally, the City must hold two public hearings prior to the adoption of a One-Year Action Plan allocating federal CDBG and HOME Program funds. This public hearing will satisfy one of the two meeting requirements to receive public input and recommendations for the Proposed FY 2017-18 Action Plan. The City will hold another public hearing prior to the adoption of the Proposed FY 2017-18 Action Plan."}, "title": " Five-Year Financial Forecast and Fiscal Year (FY) 2016-17 Midyear Budget", "Sponsors": "Director Donna Peter, Director Susan Cline", "recommendations": ["     Appropriate FY 2016-17 midyear expenditure and revenue budget adjustments as detailed in the report.", "", "", "     Review and provide policy direction on the FY 2017-18 through FY 2021-22 Five-Year Financial Forecast and direct staff to proceed with developing a fiscally sustainable budget strategy;", "     Adopt a resolution establishing classification and salary rates for various positions;", "     Approve the position and classification changes;", "     Authorize the City Manager to accept a grant award in the amount of $38,000 from the California State Library for the California Library Literacy Services program;", "     Authorize the City Manager to accept a grant award in the amount of $1,000 from Centro Latino for Literacy for the Leamos (Lets Read) @ the Library project; and", "     Receive public comment on federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Home Investment Partnership Act (HOME) Program funds."], "Department": "Finance Department, Budget Division"}], [], [], [], [], [{"Department": "Records & Elections Services Department", "Category": "13.

The Fire Department also has another 25 vehicles and pieces of equipment that use diesel fuel, and the Water Resources Division has four diesel storage tanks for their generators at various locations. Although the City strives to reduce the number of diesel-powered equipment as new technologies become available, there are no readily available alternatives for the heavy-duty equipment. The cost differential between renewable diesel and conventional diesel fuel is $0.022 per gallon in Los Angeles County, which would equate to an increase of approximately $1,170 annually if the City were to replace conventional diesel fuel with renewable diesel, based on the Citys average usage of 53,104 gallons per year.The City has diesel fuel tanks at the following locations: SiteTank Capacity (in gallons)City Yards (Tank 1)6,500City Yards (Tank 2)6,500Beach Maintenance Facility2,000Fire Station #12,150Fire Station #2900Fire Station #3950Fire Station #52,150Arcadia Water Treatment Plant5,000Charnock Well Station3,000Moss Avenue Pump Station1,000San Vicente Well Station5,000 The availability of renewable diesel fuel addresses the need to reduce carbon and greenhouse gas emissions, where other alternative fuel options are not available. Average reductions in criteria pollutants when comparing renewable diesel against conventional diesel usage, are as follows: NOX emissions:    -10%Particulate Matter (PM) emissions:  -30%Carbon Monoxide (CO) emissions: -35%Total Hydrocarbon emissions:  -40% With respect to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions the CARB calculates the carbon intensity, or the entire field to fuel tank carbon footprint, of renewable diesel to be 58.47% lower than that of conventional diesel. Because renewable diesel is considered a drop-in fuel, the City would be able to significantly reduce GHG emissions without the need to retrofit infrastructure or vehicles.The State of Californias procurement process allows for other local municipalities to use contract 1-15-91-31D, Supplement 2 for the purchase of renewable and red dye renewable diesel fuel. Although there have been no issues with availability and delivery of renewable diesel fuel, should renewable diesel fuel become unavailable, under the terms of this contract ultra-low sulfur diesel #2 (ULSD #2) would be purchased until renewable diesel could again be delivered.  Vendor SelectionStaff recommends Pinnacle Petroleum, Inc. to furnish and deliver renewable diesel fuel as an exemption to the competitive process. Section 2.24.080(b) of the Santa Monica Municipal Code, Exception to Competitive Bidding, allows the City to use a competitive bidding process that has already been completed by Federal, State, County, City, or special district government agencies, to purchase the same supplies or equipment that the other entity has already purchased under an existing bid. Staff recommends utilizing this process in order to obtain the most competitive pricing for renewable diesel fuel. The State has already engaged in the competitive bidding process, resulting in State of California contract No. 1-15-91-31D.#0 The purchase orders to be awarded to Pinnacle Petroleum, Inc. are for a not to exceed amount of $512,250.

Renewable diesel fuel is not a petroleum-based product. Feedstocks for the production of renewable diesel fuel sold in California come from waste animal fat from the food processing industry and from waste fat from the fish processing industry. This fuel type is produced through the process of hydrotreating, which produces an end product, which is chemically equivalent to conventional diesel fuel. In July 2013, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and the State Water Resources Control Board released a joint statement through the State of California Governors Office, indicating that renewable diesel should be treated the same as conventional CARB diesel for all purposes, including storage in underground storage tanks. The statement also noted that renewable diesel is considered a drop-in fuel that can be used with existing infrastructure and diesel engines and that it meets the requirements for conventional diesel and ASTM D975-12a specifications and should be treated no differently than conventional diesel fuel that is legal for sale in California.In August 2015, the State of California solicited bids for the purchase and delivery of renewable and red dye renewable diesel fuel, which included a stipulation that the contract would be available for use by participating local agencies. Red dye renewable diesel has a small amount of red dye added to the fuel to denote that the fuel is to be used in off-road vehicles only, due to the fact that road taxes are removed from the cost of the fuel.

Agreement #9210 (CCS) with Xerox expires on June 30, 2017 with one remaining two-year renewal option. Xerox assists the City with the administrative processes of the parking citations the City issues. Xerox processes the citations by uploading the citations to its citation and permit management system daily; accepting citation payments in person, by mail or online; responding to phone inquiries; and mailing legal and payment notices to the vehicles registered owners. The California vehicle code entitles registered owners to certain appeal processes after a citation is issued. These appeal procedures consist of an initial review and/or an administrative hearing. Xerox is tasked with the intake of these appeals, assigning them to the appropriate departments for response, managing the administrative hearing schedules, and notifying the register owners of the appeal decisions. In addition, Xerox is tasked with the collection of unpaid citations. Xerox, on behalf of the City, notifies the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and/or Franchise Tax Board (FTB) of any unpaid citations, tracks the remittances intercepted by these agencies, and applies them to the appropriate citations accordingly.  In 2016 the City issued over 280,000 parking citations. Approximately 18,500 of these citations resulted in the customers requesting an initial review for the validity of the citation, and 1,800 of the customers found to be liable proceeded to request an administrative hearing from the Citys hearing officer for an independent review. As a result, Xerox responded to over 40,000 phone inquiries, and mailed 13,000 unpaid notices to DMV and 1,000 notices to FTB respectively.  For parking permit processing, Xerox is responsible for processing over 50,000 parking permit renewals every year for the preferential parking program. There are four renewal cycles every calendar year with a total of over 20,000 customer accounts. Xerox works closely with staff to send out renewal notices to existing account holders and process the renewals accordingly. Customers can renew their permits online or by mail. Xerox houses and maintains the permit stock on the Citys behalf. Finally, Xerox provides payment processing services related to parking citation processing and parking permit fulfillment including lockbox services, which helps simplify collection and processing of receivable payments. Assignment of AgreementOn January 29, 2016, Xerox announced its plan to separate into two independent, publicly traded Fortune 500 companies: a document technology company known as Xerox Corporation and a business process outsourcing company known as Conduent Incorporated. The separation concluded and, as of January 1, 2017, the business process services provided by Xerox Corporation is now conducted under the new name Conduent, Inc. As of February 16, 2017, Xerox State & Local Solutions, Inc., an indirect but wholly owned subsidiary of Conduent, Inc. changed its name to Conduent State & Local Solutions, Inc. to align itself more clearly with the Conduent brand. The name change does not affect the contract between Conduent and its customers and business partners as Conduent State & Local Solutions, Inc. remains the same legal entity with the same employer identification number (EIN) after the name change. Contract ExtensionStaff explored the possibility of issuing a new RFP to obtain a new service provider for the range of services currently provided by Xerox. This exploration was also intended to identify available new technologies relating to citation/permit issuance and management since the contract was executed. While new and improved technologies exist, there are few companies that are able to provide the full range of services desired by the City. Staff recommends extending the agreement with Xerox to minimize any service interruptions while continuing to allow staff to explore other possibilities for the best integrated parking solution. Contract ModificationsThe amount of the agreement is dependent on the number of citations and parking permits issued. The original agreement was approved at an estimated amount of $1,400,000 per year, or $12.6 million for the duration of the agreement if all renewal options were exercised. The City has spent close to $9.4 million since the inception of the agreement through FY 2015-16, and is projected to spend an estimated additional amount of $4.6 million between FY 2016-17 and FY 2018-19 on all contracted services, bringing the estimated total to $14 million for the duration of the agreement. Staff recommends a fourth modification in the estimated amount of $1.9 million (includes 10% contingency), with an estimated agreement amount of $14.5 million, with future year funding contingent on Council budget approval. Staff also recommends a fourth modification of the agreement to include some provisions that are now City standards for contractual services such as terminating an agreement at the Citys convenience. While Xerox has primarily met its contractual obligations, there have been a few performance issues since contract inception. During the same time period, the Parking Operations Division experienced several staff turnovers, which created continuity issues and made contract oversight more challenging. In 2016 staff met with Xerox management on multiple occasions to address the performance issues. Xeroxs contract performance has greatly improved and staff is working closely with the Xerox team to continue to improve and ensure a seamless contracting relationship. To more effectively manage this agreement, staff recommends the following conditions in the fourth modification: Extend the term to June 30, 2018 and provide one remaining one-year renewal option. The total contract term remains at nine years. Following the last option period, staff will issue a new RFP for citation and permit processing services. Include an option for the City to terminate the agreement for convenience. Include an option to allow the City to terminate the agreement in parts or in whole. Revise the performance standards for parking permit fulfillment to include a penalty provision so it is consistent for all contracted services. Vendor SelectionOn November 23, 2009, the three Westside cities of Santa Monica, West Hollywood, and Beverly Hills jointly issued a RFP for citation processing, handheld devices, license plate readers, and permit processing systems. The RFP was broadly publicized by all three cities. Four proposals were received to deliver all requested services; one proposal was received for only handheld citation devices. A selection committee of representatives from all three cities reviewed the proposals and unanimously selected Xerox (then ACS State & Local Solutions, Inc.) as the best bidder based on price, range of products and services offered, ability to address the Westside cities issues, and commitment to implement an integrated parking solution. ", "background": "On November 23, 2009, the three Westside cities of Santa Monica, West Hollywood, and Beverly Hills jointly issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for citation processing, handheld devices, license plate readers, and permit processing systems. The objectives stated in the RFP conform to the recommendations in the 2009 Walker Parking Study for an integrated parking management solution. The intended benefit of a joint RFP was economies of scale and working collaboratively as one entity in terms of service and performance standards, but each of the three Westside cities would award its own contract with the selected vendor. Four proposals were received and Xerox (then ACS State & Local Solutions, Inc.) was unanimously selected as the best bidder based on price, range of products and services offered, ability to address the Westside cities issues, and commitment to implement an integrated parking solution. On May 11, 2010, Council authorized the City Manager to negotiate and execute agreement # 9210 (CCS) with ACS State & Local Solutions, Inc. in the estimated average amount of $1,400,000 per year for a period of five years, with two additional two-year renewal options, to provide parking citation processing, parking permit fulfillment, and payment processing services. The parking permit fulfillment portion of the agreement would be implemented in four phases as Xerox had to build new software solutions to provide the services. In April 2012 agreement #9210 (CCS) was assigned to Xerox following the name change as a result of ACS State & Local Solutions, Inc. being acquired by Xerox. There have been three modifications to agreement #9210 (CCS) through administrative procedures as these modifications did not alter the terms or contract amount. On July 10, 2012, the City issued a first modification to accommodate new functionality and clarify services to be provided by Xerox, including allowing Xerox to also accept American Express payments in addition to VISA and MasterCard and allowing the City to purchase permit stock from Xerox per the Citys specifications. On February 13, 2013, the City issued a second modification to accommodate reimbursement to Xerox for postage and mailing costs related to the services provided. On June 23, 2015, the City issued a third modification to exercise the first renewal option and extend the term to June 30, 2017, clarify the additional services to be performed by Xerox per the original agreement, and revise the pricing schedule. ", "summary": " The City currently contracts with Xerox State & Local Solutions, Inc.

Staff recommends utilizing this process in this case in order to obtain the most competitive pricing, expedite vehicle purchases, and ensure that vehicle specifications match those that have already been specifically developed for and utilized by law enforcement and emergency response agencies. Many local government agencies take advantage of the pricing offered under State contracts for these reasons. Using the States bid allows the City to obtain the most competitive price as a result of discounts afforded by vendors that have established contract pricing. If Santa Monica were to conduct its own Formal Bid, staff estimates it would take at least one year to complete, utilizing significant staff time and resources.   Fleet Management obtained copies of the original bidding documentation from the State award and reviewed them with the Finance Department.

In August 2008, a third route was added - the Sunset Ride - connecting the Bundy and Main campuses. Council authorized the implementation of the Any Line, Any Time program with SMC with the adoption of the Fiscal Year 2008-10 Short Range Transit Plan adopted on March 25, 2008. Big Blue Bus implemented the unlimited ride transit program with SMC in the fall of 2008. The agreement was most recently renewed onMay 27, 2014 for the period of July 1, 2014  June 30, 2017, increasing the fixed annual amounts $1,356,551 in FY 2014-15, $1,404,030 in FY 2015-16, and $1,453,172 in FY 2016-17, representing a seven percent increase over a three-year period.  During the past year, the City and SMC have engaged in discussions on the importance of continuing the Any Line, Any Time program. Staff recommends entering into the proposed three‑year agreement to provide for sustained financial planning for both SMC and the City, as well as acknowledging the success of the program providing a reliable mobility option to students. ", "summary": "In August 2015, the City Council adopted five Strategic Goals providing staff direction on Councils overarching priorities for the City. One of the five Strategic Goals is to create a new model for mobility. None of the five strategies were new efforts, although each involved a refocusing on tangible long-term outcomes. Similarly, Big Blue Bus began assessing each of its existing and new initiatives against Councils adopted priorities, chief among them being mobility, and evolved its reporting of benchmarks and outcomes through the Strategic Goals focus. Big Blue Bus Any Line, Any Time program is one such existing program that reflects BBBs commitment to strategic mobility goals that lead to enhanced adoption of ridership among young riders. Big Blue Bus (BBB) has had annual agreements since 2007 with SMC to provide unlimited access to BBB transit services for all student, staff, and faculty members who choose to participate in the Any Line, Any Time program.  Under this agreement, BBB charges SMC a fixed annual amount for all passengers with a valid, activated SMC identification card bearing a current semester sticker.  The SMC Partnership was most recently renewed at the May 27, 2014 Council meeting for a three-year period covering July 1, 2014  June 30, 2017.

Santa Monicas key objectives for the FY2017-18 funding period include:          Expanding housing opportunities for low-income households through an increase in the supply of decent, safe, and affordable housing and rental assistance;         Supporting efforts to help homeless or near-homeless Santa Monica residents secure adequate temporary and permanent housing and receive necessary supportive services;         Focus on assisting persons to develop skill sets and linking these persons to actual jobs once training is complete; and         Improving accessibility for persons living with disabilities and seniors; and completing improvements to infrastructure including broadband for affordable housing buildings. Both programs benefit residents with special needs and incomes at or below 80% of area median income (low and moderate income). The Citys total estimated CDBG and HOME allocation for FY2017-18 is $1.5 million, reflecting level funding in program and administrative revenues from FY2016-17. The City will also program $360,000 in unallocated prior year funds and an additional $187,000 in anticipated program income resulting from repayment of affordable housing loans originally provided using CDBG and HOME funds. The FY2017-18 estimated funding allocations include:           CDBG: $1,027,760 in new federal funds, $360,000 in prior year unallocated funds and $87,000 in projected program income funds for capital projects, public service and administration activities.          HOME: $439,447 in new federal funds and $100,000 in program income for tenant-based rental assistance and administration. CDBG and HOME programs provide funding to support affordable housing, capital improvements, and administrative reimbursement. In accordance with federal regulations, a maximum of 15 percent of current year CDBG funding may be allocated for public service to nonprofit organizations. Public service allocations support operating grants that address and prevent homelessness by providing support services to low-income households, including people who are homeless or at high risk of homelessness, people with disabilities, and the frail elderly. While the City has committed $201,268 in annual CDBG funding to nonprofits through FY2018-19, the remaining funding allocated in the FY2017-18 Action Plan is for one-time, shovel ready projects which are not dependent on future funding. Regardless, any cuts to future allocations will erode the Citys social safety net and limit capital improvements to low-income areas and public facilities.

The purpose is to raise funds to enhance the Librarys facilities and services; to encourage gifts, endowments and bequests for the enrichment of the Librarys collections; and to contribute to the cultural life of Santa Monica by offering a variety of programs for all ages.  Prior to 2006 the Friends of the Library had storage for materials and workspace in the basement of the Main Library located at 1343 6th Street. They also held bi-annual book sales in the parking garage of the Main Library. In 2006 the Friends of the Library began operating a 1,635 square foot bookstore on the premises of the Main Library located at 601 Santa Monica Blvd., which allowed them to be regularly open to the public. The Friends currently provide approximately $100,000 in annual funding to the Library, and much of that funding is revenue from the sales of material in the Friends bookstore. The bookstore provides the public access to inexpensive books, DVDs, CDs, audiobooks, and other media. It is also a resource that encourages the reuse of materials through community donations and library discards. In order to continue to operate the bookstore on Library property, contribute funds to Library programs and services, and enhance the learning and thriving of Santa Monica residents, the Library and the Friends Board of Directors wish to memorialize the relationship between the Library and the Friends by adopting an operating agreement.  The Friends use the premises to operate a used bookstore which generally involves coordinating volunteers, processing donated materials it has received (e.g., new and used books, library discards, magazines, CDs, DVDs, audiobooks, and other media appropriate for resale), and storing, sorting, pricing, and selling said material.  Staff have reviewed operating agreements and best practices between Friends of the Library organizations and libraries in neighboring communities. The Friends of the Library Board of Directors voted to accept the operating principles of the agreement at their Board meeting on March 13, 2017. Staff recommends that the City Council authorize the City Manager to negotiate and execute a formal operating agreement with the Friends of the Santa Monica Public Library to establish the following terms and conditions under which the City will continue to provide the Friends with space to operate a bookstore on the premises of the Main Library: The City has allocated 1,635 square feet of space to the Friends for the book store operation on Library premises.   The term of the agreement will be for one year and will be automatically extended for additional one-year periods up through 2027, unless terminated for cause or in the event the Library must reclaim the premises for core Library services.   The Friends will use the premises to operate a used book store, which involves receiving donated materials (e.g., new and used books, magazines, library discards, and other media appropriate for resale), and storing, sorting, pricing, and selling said material.   The Friends will use all book store net proceeds (i.e., revenue receipts, less bookstore expenses) to support Santa Monica Public Library programming and operations.   The Friends shall procure and maintain for the duration of the agreement a commercial general liability insurance policy with limits of no less than $1,000,000 per occurrence against claims for injuries to persons or damages to property that may arise from or in connection with the operation and use of the premises by the Friends, its agents, representatives, employees, or subcontractors.  The City is committed to strengthening partnerships with civic, non-profit, neighborhood and business organizations. The long-standing relationship with the Friends not only provides the Library with significant funding and the amenity of a used bookstore widely enjoyed by Library patrons, it also provides an organized bond between the Public Library and the public that our libraries serve.  An alternative solution would include a higher level of staff involvement in oversight and day to day operation of the bookstore. Day to day operation of the bookstore includes establishing policies and procedures, recruitment and training of volunteers, scheduling bookstore volunteers, sales and cash handling, and customer service.

Study Sessions", "body": {"other": "Santa Monica staff, residents and stakeholders have been actively pursuing the Councils strategic goal of Establishing a New Model for Mobility. The goal is supported and enriched by connections with the Sustainable City Plan, Wellbeing Project and Land Use and Circulation Element. Efforts like GoSaMo have encouraged Santa Monica residents and visitors to try a variety of mobility options. Strategic planning through the Pedestrian Action Plan and Bike Action Plan organize a multi-faceted approach that has resulted in many more people walking and biking in our community. The Bike Action Plan marked its 5-year anniversary this year with substantial progress in striping of the 5-year bike network, and opening of multi-year work efforts like the Esplanade, the California Incline and Breeze Bike Share. The Pedestrian Action Plan completed its first year with COAST Open Streets and Downtown Pedestrian scramble all-way crossings as primary accomplishments.  The 2016 Resident Travel Survey showed that residents were walking and biking for 22.6% of daily trips before Expo Light Rail opened. With Expo Light Rail operating, pedestrian demand citywide has noticeably increased with new destinations, pathways and people walking. This increase from new mobility options and encouragement underscores the need to actively re-engineer our street environment and to inform the public to achieve our Vision Zero goal to eliminate traffic fatalities and serious injuries. The result is a complete mobility network that rebalances decades of auto-centric planning to create public spaces that are more diverse, as well as community-oriented and environmentally friendly.  So far in 2017, Santa Monica has seen an unusual spike in fatal and severe pedestrian-involved collisions. Similar disturbing trends are being reported in Los Angeles and in other cities nationwide. Staff from the Mobility Division and the Santa Monica Police Department (SMPD) undertook a review of trend data related to traffic collisions within City boundaries. Between 2006 and 2016, Santa Monica traffic collisions resulted in an average of 26 fatalities and severe injuries among all roadway users. Vehicle collisions are 82% of all reported incidents, but 70% of all reported fatalities are pedestrians and bicyclists. Incidents are happening throughout Santa Monica, primarily on major thoroughfares with the highest volume of traffic. Major collision factors are unsafe speeds and right-of-way violations, and SMPD citations are written in a similar proportion to violations. In addition to enforcement, City staff actively engages the community to encourage safe behaviors on the road in meetings, videos and print media.Current policy makers inherited a landscape designed for the automobile during fifty years of national, state and local myopia in seeing streets strictly as conveyances for auto and truck circulation. Santa Monica has been a pioneer in reviving the principle that streets are for people whether they are walking, biking, taking transit or driving their own vehicles. We are, however, a long way from reversing the legacy of engineering and investment decisions that advantaged auto mobility and relegated pedestrian, bike, and transit mobility to second-class status at best.  Looking ahead, the landscape of mobility is changing rapidly due to policy and technology evolution. In this time of transition, Santa Monica can continue to be a leader in new ways of designing, managing and regulating our streets to serve all people, guided by community values of sustainability, diversity, and wellbeing. It is important to recognize, however, the scale of this challenge  and the opportunity it represents for Santa Monica to be a model for enhancing transportation choices, innovation and safety. Pedestrian Action PlanAdopted in February 2016, the Pedestrian Action Plan just went through its first year of implementation. It was a fortuitous year, synchronized with opening of the Expo Light Rail and GoSaMo outreach, that encouraged and celebrated walking in Santa Monica. Whether you are one-year or one-hundred years old, walking is an activity done by everyone-- on two feet, with a walker, or in a wheelchair. From walking the dog, strolling on the beach or running to the corner store, walking provides the foundation of both the transportation system and much of the fabric of life in Santa Monica. Despite the fact that walking is a part of all trips, whether as the primary mode of travel or a way to get from a bus or car to the final destination, walking is often taken for granted. A complete, high-quality pedestrian network is therefore necessary to make all aspects of the transportation system work well. Hundreds of people participated in creation of the Pedestrian Action Plan and their input shaped its four essential themes: Walking is part of the Santa Monica lifestyle and enhances wellbeing.  More pedestrians of all ages and abilities, and fewer collisions.  Improve walking and reduce obstacles like freeway and boulevard crossings.  Walking is a shared priority, and safety is shared responsibility. The Pedestrian Action Plan also included an analysis of anticipated pedestrian demand (based on land use, transit facilities and socio-economics), pedestrian supply (such as sidewalk widths and marked crosswalks), and a decade of pedestrian-involved collision reports to develop a robust and fact-based plan of action.  The Pedestrian Action Plans action strategy is organized into 9 Practices, 13 Programs, and 84 Projects. Practices include how City departments approach their daily activities relative to pedestrians. Programs engage people to reduce the social and perceptual barriers to walking, and encourage more people to walk safely. Projects improve the infrastructure for walking, and the Project list is broken down into 5-, 10- and 15-year segments. To measure performance, the Plan recommends a biennial report card beginning in 2018 that measures progress toward Vision Zero, mode share of walk trips (as total trips, commute trips, and school trips), and progress on capital project construction. Progress on the first year of Pedestrian Action Plan implementation is described below in the three major action categories (see Attachment A for more details).  PracticesChanges to City practices address daily work habits, policies and priorities to increase the efficiency of implementing Pedestrian Action Plan recommendations. Although they can seem obscure or small, changes to practice can be powerful because they leverage existing efforts to achieve new goals. However, changes to practice need to be catalyzed and guided, which requires staff effort and focus. Once institutionalized, the benefits can be on-going and require much less investment. Three practice changes were started in the first year:  Reduced Vehicle Speed in School Zones: Council adopted 15 mile per hour (mph) speed limits on neighborhood streets adjacent to the communitys public K-12 schools, taking advantage of changes in state law. Sign installation is anticipated this summer.  Use of a Project Charter: City Departments have agreed to use a project charter memo to document project goals and milestones, with the intent that key pedestrian designs, amenities or community preferences are not lost in engineering.  Lead Pedestrian Intervals (LPIs) provide a head start for pedestrians crossing at signalized intersections. These few additional seconds increase pedestrian visibility to motorists. LPIs were created on Olympic Drive at Ocean Avenue and Main Street, and for crossings of Lincoln Boulevard at Marine Street, Ashland Avenue and Pearl Street. More locations are being identified. Efforts to coordinate the many positive activities and efforts already underway, and to institutionalize slight changes in practices that aid pedestrians, can generate significant advancements in Plan implementation. Additional benefit will come from practices that reduce vehicle speeds, and facilitate roadway design, signal and street operations that put people first. Other cities have developed Street Design and Operations Guides with performance goals that catalyze more complete street solutions. Prioritizing pedestrians in work plans and in the project and program development process, supported by a pedestrian coordinator is recommended by the Pedestrian Action Plan.  ProgramsPrograms provide encouragement, outreach, education and a human touch to support walking in Santa Monica. COAST Open Streets, held in June, 2016, was the biggest and most encompassing pedestrian program in the Pedestrian Action Plans first year. Two miles of streets were closed to cars, while approximately 50,000 enthusiastic participants experienced Santa Monica on wheels and on foot. Local businesses, organizations, community groups, and City departments produced interactive, engaging activity hubs along the route that included the Main Street Farmers market. Main Street was often filled with people strolling and stopping to take in the performances, socialize, shop or just enjoy the street space. Metro partially funded this first event, and a second grant will be used to partially fund a 2018 Open Streets event. Planning is underway for Santa Monicas second COAST Open Streets Festival to be held on October 1, 2017.   The Safe Routes to School (SRTS) program connected with students and parents through Bike-It! Walk-It! Bus-It! days, which this school year included a walking school bus organized by parents at McKinley Elementary. Walking to school continues to be a popular option, although much work has yet to be done to increase the percentage of kids walking to school and create less stressful conditions during drop-off. SRTS education is happening through CREST afterschool programs and during events like the Fall Festival, COAST and National Night Out.         Other programs recommended in the Pedestrian Action Plan underway this year included:  Walking Tours - GoSaMo piloted walking tours such as a history tour with Tom Explores Los Angeles and a food tour with Hedley & Bennett. Santa Monica Conservancy continued its weekly walking tours of Downtown history.  Safety Campaigns - The Police Department created a Move Safe campaign of public service announcements, videos, and print media. The Move Safe messaging was included on the back of the thousands of City-issued parking hang tags.  Street Activation through Art and Special Amenities - Lincoln Boulevard traffic signal boxes were treated with creative designs. Creative crosswalks were piloted at two Downtown intersections. Artwork is being planned for the Colorado Esplanade that will be tied to an experience along the Promenade that encourages people to walk all the way up to Wilshire Boulevard. The Pedestrian Action Plan recommends a number of additional programs, including group walking events, a series of mapped walking routes, walking challenges, and communications that encourage walking as an alternative to other modes. It identifies opportunities to focus on segments of the community with unique needs such as initiating a walking group for seniors or in certain neighborhoods, recurring walking events such as Walk with a Doc, or monthly themed walks in association with the Wellbeing Office, Safe Routes to School or Buy Local. The Pedestrian Action Plan recommends creating a Safe Routes for Seniors program to provide active opportunities for seniors to foster healthy aging and longer years of independent living. Staff convened a group of community stakeholders and senior service providers to brainstorm possible program components. Using these ideas, staff prepared grant requests to the State Active Transportation Program (ATP) and Regional Sustainability Planning Grants programs. The applications scored well, but did not receive grant funding.   ProjectsThe 5-year project list in the Pedestrian Action Plan consists of seventeen projects that were anticipated or budgeted in the Citys Capital Improvement Program (CIP) from Metro Call for Projects or State Active Transportation Program grants. A two-year Pedestrian Action Plan allocation was made in the FY16-18 CIP that will be used for 2017 COAST Open Streets Event. Work underway from the 5-year project list includes:         Pedestrian-oriented lighting on Michigan Avenue between 9th and 17th Streets and along portions of Stewart Street at Kansas Avenue. Pedestrian-scale lighting supports people to walk comfortably at night, especially in areas with dense tree cover. Michigan lighting will be complete this summer, and Stewart Street in early 2018.         Three parklets on Main Street are opening in June as places for people to take a break, enjoy local activity and create a social space that increases pedestrian comfort.          Safe Routes to School enhancements for Edison Language Academy will provide curb extensions, new crosswalks and/or raised crosswalks, consistent with the Michigan Avenue Neighborhood Greenway plan.         Lincoln Boulevard bus lane and pedestrian improvements with a first phase that will include new crossings, and curb extensions.          Pedestrian wayfinding signs around each Expo Light Rail station that give direction, walking time, and biking time to major public locations.The California Incline and Pedestrian Bridge, and the Colorado Esplanade were completed in 2016 with major new pedestrian facilities. The Esplanades signature sidewalks are used by thousands of people daily as they crisscross the Downtown, Civic Center, Expo Station and Pier. While these multi-year projects were hitting construction completion, pedestrian scramble phases were added to 12 intersections in Downtown as a jump-start project of the Mobility Strategic Goal. The scrambles increase pedestrian visibility and awareness in the Citys highest pedestrian-volume intersections, and eliminate potential conflicts between pedestrians and left-turning vehicles. Additionally, intersections at Arizona Avenue/Second Street and Ocean Avenue/Broadway were painted with creative unique designs that celebrated unique site features. These creative crosswalks were a pilot place-making program that is currently being evaluated.  The GoSaMo outreach efforts in the last year helped to leverage investments in physical projects by encouraging more people to use them. The campaign was launched with the light rail but encourages walking along with other modes. GoSaMo created a unified identity for mobility that assisted with outreach and making connections with people. GoSaMo created tools to engage with people about walking, and helped facilitate conversations about a mode of travel that is arguably the most popular of all among Santa Monicans.   Planning and design is starting on a few projects right now, including sidewalks on Olympic Boulevard from 26th to Stewart Street, lighting and upgrades to Fourth Street south of Colorado Avenue, and pedestrian lighting and curb extensions on 17th Street from Pico to Wilshire. Progress to encourage walking could be catalyzed through other projects identified in adopted plans including Safe Routes to School access improvements at active schools like McKinley Elementary, Neighborhood Greenway Projects in the Bike Action Plan like Washington Avenue, and improvements to Nebraska Avenue in the Bergamot Area Plan area. Additional investment in GoSaMo would facilitate targeting unique user groups and needs. Bike Action Plan 2016 marked the fifth anniversary of the Bike Action Plan. Since its adoption in 2011, cycling has grown in Santa Monica, evidenced by the significant numbers of people on the street and the growing range of riders. On any day in Santa Monica, one can see an incredible diversity of riders including women, men with children on board, young riders, and experienced senior riders. From 2011 to 2015, bike counts citywide grew 50% overall in the biennial transportation counts. Although the counts dropped in 2015, counts coming this fall 2017 are anticipated to increase due to Breeze Bike Share. The 2016 Resident Travel survey showed that 6% percent of all trips made by residents are on a bicycle.  The Bike Action Plan outlines a pragmatic, balanced, and ambitious strategy to achieve a 14-35% bicycle mode share through programs, bikeways and supporting facilities in 5-year and 20-year work plans. Progress on Bike Plan implementation is described below in these two categories, and includes an update on Breeze Bike Share, excerpts from the Bike Action Plan performance measures and a look ahead to the next five years. See Attachment A for additional details.  Programs Breeze Bike Share got people going and changed the cycling culture in Santa Monica. Bike Share Stations located throughout Santa Monica make Breeze virtually a door-to-door service. The point-to-point model makes cycling as convenient and flexible as walking or taking a car service, and is actually more convenient than driving because you can park right in front of your destination. In addition to convenience, the striking green color of the bikes serves as a strong visual reminder of Santa Monicas commitment to biking. Breeze bikes are always available as an option, even as a spontaneous choice since you can sign up and ride immediately. The bikes have been well-used by residents who make up 16% of subscribers and ride 46% of trips.  The bikes have on-board GPS that collects valuable data about each trip. In 2016, the Breeze system had:  309,000 bike trips 664,500 miles ridden 43,000 active subscribersThe system exceeded expectations for its first full year. Ridership for 2017 is following similar seasonal trends with an overall higher daily use. Tracking frequently-ridden routes and frequently-used stations is informing system adjustments. Routing can also be used to plan and prioritize new bikeways, or improvements to existing bikeways, such as additional buffers and intersection accommodations.  In 2016, Breeze Bike Share gave away 476 helmets at eight events to promote safety and to increase membership. In November, Breeze celebrated its one-year anniversary with over 100 community members on a community ride and party. This year Breeze continues its education and engagement efforts by: hosting quarterly community rides where participants can try Breeze for the first time, giving away over 500 helmets to new users, promoting the Employee Benefits Program that gives discounts to employers who bulk purchase Breeze memberships for their employees, and partnering with Community Corps of Santa Monica (CCSM) and Santa Monica Spoke to teach smart cycling classes at CCSM properties and help CCSM residents subscribe to Breeze for greatly reduced rates. Breeze riders can already use their accounts to ride in systems in West Hollywood, Beverly Hills and Long Beach (and UCLA this fall) as a pay-as-you-go rider. Staff is working on a Memorandum of Understanding with these other agencies to add additional features for customers that further integrate the systems.  Many Santa Monica residents continue to feel unsure on a bicycle. Making connections with people about biking in Santa Monica is the cornerstone of the awareness and encouragement program. This takes many forms - events, classes, friendly challenges, and partnerships. The Citys Bike Coordinator works to implement an annual program of events that meet residents where they are going, and forge partnerships that extend the reach of Citys efforts including:          May 2016 Bike Month - Council honored engaged residents with a proclamation of Bike Month. A GEAR UP for Bike Month festival was hosted at McKinley Elementary including bike rodeo, bike swap, family bike testing and bike accessories. Over 400 people attended and 50 bike swaps were made to get kids and parents the right fitting bike. Over 200 people stopped by the City Hall Bike to Work Day Pit Stop, and hundreds more participated. Santa Monica Spoke promoted events throughout the month. All of these programs are being offered again in 2017.         Safe Routes to School: Bicycling was a feature of most Safe Routes programs this year. Over 900 Samohi sophomores completed a one-hour cycling safety class enabled by grant funds and administration support. Six bike safety skills trainings also taught 150 youth through the CREST afterschool program.         Rides: Five Kidical Mass Rides welcomed over 300 participants for fun family ride together while also learning safe riding techniques, bike fit and helmet fit (Valentines Day, Earth Day, July 4th, Kidical Mass-IVE, Halloween). A monthly ride with the Mayor was kicked off in January.         Bike Rodeos: SM Spoke partners with the City on four rodeos where kids learned riding and road skills. This fun activity is becoming a beloved component of Santa Monica community events.          Bike Center: 2016 was also the 5-year anniversary of Santa Monicas Bike Center Downtown that provides rental, repair and commuter services. The Center rents roughly 33,000 bikes a year including 10% family bike rentals of hard-to-find bikes. Sustainable Streets, an associated effort of the Bike Center, also hosted dozens of Adult Learn to Ride, Ready to Ride, Confident City Cycling and Bike Maintenance classes.          Bike Registration: Free bike registration was set up by SMPD in partnership with www.bikeindex.org <http://www.bikeindex.org>. Victims of bicycle theft can search for their property, police can identify stolen bicycles, and buyers can check that goods are not stolen. Staff has prioritized being present at the many events hosted in Santa Monica as one tool to grow bicycling into part of the culture of life in Santa Monica. Providing interactive engagement and refreshed materials at events has helped to connect with residents and employees to encourage people to bike for more trips around town. Booths, rides, displays and incentives were provided at events like the Buy Local Health & Fitness Festival, Sustainable Quality Awards, Fall Festival, Bike Expo, and many more.  In 2016, GoSaMo provided a boost of bike outreach by creating new tools to engage with people about biking. The new postcards, buttons, and activations of GoSaMo helped facilitate conversations about bicycling with people of all experience and bike-confidence levels. The bike and walking buttons were the most popular throughout GoSaMo outreach.  BikewaysIn 2016, the community celebrated the opening and operation of some long-awaited protected bikeways. These facilities were constructed along with major capital projects, and complement the Citys signature off-street path, the Marvin Braude Beach Bike Path. Although shorter in length, these protected facilities help to make cycling more comfortable and feasible for many people:          The Expo Bicycle/Pedestrian path which extends 1.4 miles in Santa Monica from 17th Street eastward to Centinela Avenue and continues into the City of Los Angeles.          The Colorado Esplanade protected bikeway from the Expo station to the Pier. It is a short .25 miles but a significant connector and heavily ridden.          The California Incline protected bikeway from Ocean Avenue to the beach. This .25 mile stretch enables a rider to go from the city to the sand without ever leaving the saddle.  At the time of Bike Action Plan adoption, Santa Monica had only six miles of off-street bike path, 31 miles of striped bike lanes, and 38 miles of bike routes (no striping). There were countless gaps in the network and many locations where one could travel for blocks without encountering a bikeway. The cycling landscape of Santa Monica is very different today. Over 110 miles of bike lanes and paths exist today, having been created through a new practice to coordinate restriping with the Citys annual roadway repaving work. Several bike lanes have been upgraded with painted buffers and/or green paint. Bike routes have been upgraded to include sharrow markings, which serve as visual reminders to drivers and cyclists alike that bikes belong in the street. In places where insufficient space existed for bike lanes in both directions, climbing lanes were installed to provide a lane in one direction and a sharrow in the other (with the sharrow downhill if a grade exists). The City is implementing its first Neighborhood Greenway in phases along Michigan Avenue and adjoining streets, providing a low-stress facility for users of all ages and abilities connecting the Pico Neighborhood to various destinations. The resulting network is dense and connects to every neighborhood, and was created with minimal loss of parking spaces or vehicle travel lanes. Whereas 2016 welcomed several large infrastructure projects, 2017 will have fewer ribbon cuttings as staff works to bring additional projects to fruition in 2018 and beyond:          Design work is underway on extension of the separated Beach Bike Path from its current terminus at Arizona Avenue to the north City limit. This will reduce conflicts along the Marvin Braude Coastal Bike Trail by separating cyclists and pedestrians.         Outreach is beginning on pedestrian lighting, curb extensions and protected bikeways on 17th Street from Wilshire to Pico Boulevard.          Design will begin for subsequent phases of the Michigan Avenue Neighborhood Greenway (MANGo) through multiple grants, including reuniting the discontinuous segments of Michigan Avenue where it is bisected by the freeway and the 20th Street Bridge.  Which is not to say that 2017 will be without its share of projects. In spring, the grant-funded Bicycle Technology Demonstration project will bring one hundred additional bicycle racks, detection for bicycles at three signalized intersections, and bike boxes at the intersections of 11th Street/Broadway and Ocean Avenue/California Avenue. The racks will fulfill requests received from the community over the past two years. In fall a Metro grant will enable 1,250 additional racks, and high-visibility green markings to many bikeways between Montana Avenue and Ocean Park Boulevard. Five Year Performance IndicatorsThe Bike Action Plan identifies a set of eleven performance indicators in three categories (Mode Share, Safety, and Infrastructure and Services). Since adoption of the Bike Action Plan, improvement has been realized in virtually all performance indicator categories and excerpts are summarized below. A few have plateaued or gone down slightly over the past year.  The mode share for employees of large employers in Santa Monica who commute by bicycle is 4%, while 59% drive alone. These figures represent both residents and non-residents who work at local employers with 30 or more employees. The bicycle mode share decreased one percentage point since 2015. The 2015 citywide count of peak hour cyclists is 12,061, down 15% from 2013. This decrease belies the larger overall trend in cycling since 2007, which has increased over 50%. Counts will be conducted again in 2017 and an increase in ridership is anticipated with the presence of Breeze Bike Share.  There were 116 cyclist-involved crashes in 2016 which is a 7.4% increase from 2015 but an overall 13.4% decrease since 2014. Five new lane miles were added to the bicycle network in 2016 which is an increase of almost 5%.  Public bicycle parking was increased by 162 spaces, or 5.4%. Increases included bike lockers and racks installed by the City or Metro at the three Expo stations. Metro bike lockers have a waiting list of 25-30 people for each station.          Since bike parking requirements were increased in the Zoning Ordinance, dozens of private properties have been reviewed that provide improved on-site bike parking for employees, customers and residents.  In 2016, there were 196 events with bicycle valet, with 13,512 bicycles valeted. This represents roughly the same number of events as 2015. Breeze set up drop zones at large events since they are not accepted at valets.  Santa Monica is home to eleven Bicycle Friendly Businesses and one Bicycle Friendly University (Santa Monica College). Main Street added new bicycle retailers bringing the districts total to seven bike shops. The first bike feedback display and counter was installed in front of City Hall. Over 60,000 bikes have been counted since January 1, 2017, and the data is publicly available on a website <http://eco-public.com/public2/?id=100034648>.   Looking Beyond the Bike Plans First 5 YearsWhile staff is optimistic that traffic counts to be conducted later this year will show an increase in cycling trips over 2015, some stakeholders have been critical that cycling has not grown at a faster rate. Many communities are looking for ways to increase the opportunities for biking to achieve sustainability, health and wellbeing goals. Cities are joined by non-profit groups like People or Bikes, The Alliance for Walking and Biking, and the League of American Bicyclists, and locally by Santa Monica Spoke, a chapter of the Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition. The Bike Action Plan targets a 14-35% cycling mode share, which is currently at 4% for employees according to annual employer surveys, and 6% for resident trips according to the 2016 Resident Travel Survey. Some inspiration for Santa Monicas next phase of Bike Action Plan implementation can be found in the work of these groups and agencies: People For Bikes offers a Big Jump Project that supports cities to realize a 2-3x increase in cycling mode share. People for Bikes leverage the citys capital investments with training, outreach and communications, data collection support, and research. Staff applied in 2016 but was not selected.  Outreach, Outreach, and more Outreach - Continue regular events, including Kidical Mass rides, the Gear Up event, and Bike It! Walk It! Bus It! days at all public schools in Santa Monica which appeal to kids and families. Expand the type and style of outreach to bring more people to the events. Create new tools to keep events fresh and interesting. Celebrate successes - use communications to build on and reinforce the capital investments in new facilities. Create communications material about new facilities and do outreach to celebrate openings and invite people to try them.  A data-driven approach - create a framework for the collection and evaluation of bicycling data using crash data, trips made on Breeze bike share, traffic counts, smart phone or app data, and potentially user surveys.  Strategic outreach and activities - develop additional targeted outreach tools and messages for other user groups that could see an increase in riding. Identify and focus on target audiences. The City could use GoSaMo as a base to develop targeted outreach. Santa Monica received the prestigious Silver Bicycle Friendly Community ranking form the League of American Bicyclists in 2013. The League renewed the Citys Silver level ranking and made recommendations for improvement including institutionalizing the Vision Zero goal, adopting a Complete Streets policy and to establish a Bicycle & Pedestrian Advisory Committee. Santa Monica residents consistently provide feedback that they would bicycle more if the roadways felt more comfortable. In the 2016 Resident Travel Survey 43% of residents said that better infrastructure for walking and biking would encourage them to use those modes. Closing gaps in the network, especially near the I-10 bridges, completing the network of neighborhood greenways identified in the Bike Action Plan, and creating more physical protections for people on bikes are all possible approaches. Physically protected facilities provide barriers such as a curb, planter or parked car that provide a greater sense of comfort to people of varied ages and abilities. Barriers require reallocation of roadway space, such as changes to parking and vehicle travel lanes in instances where no other solution exists. The Bike Plan did not identify priority corridors for protected bikeways. Staff could strategically evaluate protected bikeway options based on demand, connectivity and feasibility. This would be an amendment to the Bike Action Plan, to lay the groundwork for bringing these types of facilities to more neighborhoods.  Future Policy and Technology ConsiderationsThe landscape of mobility is changing rapidly due to policy and technology changes. These changes necessitate new ways designing, managing and regulating our roadways. Santa Monica has pledged to be Carbon Neutral by 2050 or sooner, and kicked off a planning process to reach this target through the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan. Santa Monica has also committed to Wellbeing as a framework for Citywide performance management that prioritizes human health, safety, resiliency and opportunity. Globally, transportation is being driven forward by changes in technology, communications, sensing and automobile design. Staff will provide a more detailed update on these issues later this year as part of the Mobility Strategic Goal, but provides an initial discussion related to safety below.  Climate Action and Adaptation Plan (CAAP)Initial data gathering for the CAAP modeled citywide emissions and found that a startling 65 percent of emissions are generated by the transportation sector. Achieving Carbon Neutrality will require creative thinking about how we travel. Changes in fuel alone cannot achieve the significant reductions needed. Todays infrastructure does not provide the attractive and comfortable conditions to entice enough new users. A virtuous cycle of safety has been shown in many studies  the more people walking and biking on the roadways, the lower the rate of collisions with motor vehicles. This pattern was already seen in Santa Monica since 2011, when the number of people biking increased overall but the rate of collisions with motor vehicles decreased.  The resident travel survey shows that Santa Monicans are walking and biking in above-average numbers. But we are also driving short distances frequently with 62% of vehicle trips under three miles. These cold engine starts and short driving distances add to our emissions profile, and finding alternatives for some of these local trips will contribute substantially to achieving the goals of Carbon Neutrality. Making streets even more appealing to people outside a vehicle through protected and connected bike and pedestrian facilities, providing electrified first-last mile solutions that support transit use, and increasing the attractiveness of existing modes will be key.  Autonomous Vehicles Of the approximately 35,000 annual fatal collisions nationwide, approximately 95% are due to driver error (National Highway Traffic Safety Association, 2016). Common nationwide issues are driver behaviors such as alcohol impairment, distracted driving and excessive speed. As a result, autonomous vehicles (AV) are often cited as a panacea for roadway safety. Also known as driverless vehicles, the vision is for vehicles capable of sensing their environment and navigating roads without human input. There is great enthusiasm in the marketplace for AV potential, leading many car and technology companies to partner on development and testing ventures.  Enthusiasm for the potential of automation could eclipse the complex realities of human behavior on the road, unique roadway conditions typical for a community like Santa Monica, and long-term coexistence of both computer and human-controlled vehicles. AVs also have the potential to increase travel demand, which increases the exposure to crashes for all people on the road. Automation could also undermine the transit networks that move people most efficiently and safely. How cities deploy and manage these changes will make the difference between whether they result in improved mobility and safety or increased congestion and exposure. Santa Monica should actively engage with this new policy environment to influence directions that advance community values of sustainability, diversity and wellbeing.  Cities are starting to grapple with AV policy, but few have any adopted policies, practices or guidance. Santa Monica needs to begin local discussion and policy-making with regard to AVs in coordination with the Mobility Strategic Goal and to establish necessary data, communications and transportation infrastructure. Much of this conversation is happening at the state and federal levels, and Santa Monica should engage actively and create a working group to guide policies and advocacy that promote:  Safety. Encourage automation that supports Vision Zero and advocate for maximum operating speeds of 20-25mph on city streets. Ensure vehicles function in conditions with many people walking and biking, and unusual roadway configurations.   Sustainability and Wellbeing, not increased vehicle miles. Encourage electrification of AVs, shared fleets over private ownership, and shared rides.  Modernized freight and delivery. Advocate for non-peak hour deliveries, automated truck route enforcement, and use of clean truck technology. Updated funding base for transportation. Fuel and vehicle fees will see radical changes in revenue streams, look for sustainable transportation funding options under potential new automation scenarios. Local planning for the future of cities. Technology has the power to help communities achieve both their transportation and land use visions, taking public space back from space previously used by vehicles. Cities manage and control local roads so ensure local cities are at the table.  Santa Monica can look for opportunities to advocate for shared, electrified autonomous vehicles that support the sustainability and quality of life values of Santa Monica and our vision for the future. Actions may include organizing a working group, organizing and supporting a regional or sub-regional working group, or staff and elected officials actively participating in national, state or regional organizations.", "background": "At the February 14, 2017, City Council Meeting, Council instructed staff to prepare a report documenting the progress of several initiatives, including the Pedestrian Action Plan, Bicycle Action Plan, and Vision Zero. The report took on greater urgency when the City experienced a cluster of vehicle/pedestrian collisions that resulted in severe injuries and, for some of the victims, death. Santa Monica is generally, and rightfully, considered a very safe city, and the incidents caused consternation and dismay among residents, City staff, and the City Council. To address those concerns in the context of the initiatives referenced above, the City Manager encouraged staff from the Mobility Division and the SMPD to look deeper into data collected by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) and the SMPD related to traffic collisions within our borders.  The Data SMPDs Traffic Enforcement Unit, a subsection of the Strategic Services Division, completed a survey of data related to traffic collisions that occurred on City roadways from January 2013 to April 2017. The Traffic Enforcement Unit examined all traffic related incidents involving vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians, and motorcycles, and the primary collision factors associated with each collision. SMPD utilizes these statistics to determine the most efficient deployment of police education and enforcement resources, with the ultimate goal of reducing traffic collisions and achieving Vision Zero.  The Mobility Division culled information from the CHP database, and combined that with statistics from the SMPD, to create several charts and graphs studying trends in City traffic collisions. The current and potential uses for this data include (1) increasing safety and safety-awareness for drivers, riders, and pedestrians; (2) identifying, if possible, any patterns or behaviors that might be made safer; (3) testing the most appropriate metrics to quantify safety on City roadways; and (4) using the data to inform concerned citizens that Santa Monica continues to be a safe place to ride, walk, and drive. The Goals and PlansCouncils adoption of Establishing a New Model for Mobility as a strategic goal is consistent with the Citys proactive and on-going work on mobility policy, programs and implementation. The Mobility Strategic Goal encourages people to use diverse and growing mobility options. Vision Zero is one of the three preliminary targets for the Mobility Strategic Goal, along with increasing the use of walking, biking, transit and shared rides, and the creation of a complete mobility network that supports the whole trip and multiple user needs. Financial resources were allocated in FY15-16 to jump-start projects such as the Downtown Crosswalk Scrambles and outreach for Expo Light Rail/GoSaMo. Strategic Goal outcomes are being integrated into the emerging citywide performance management framework.  Santa Monicas Pedestrian Action Plan, adopted in February, 2016, is a citywide policy document that provides a focused evaluation of walking in Santa Monica, and outlines specific actions that improve the conditions and comfort for people walking. It builds upon the vision of the 2010 Land Use and Circulation Element (LUCE) as well as the Sustainable City Plan. The Pedestrian Action Plan was generated from community input, detailed data analysis, and interdepartmental collaboration among the Police, Community and Cultural Services, Public Works and Planning and Community Development Departments. It is based on detailed analysis of many factors, including where pedestrian demand is highest, where pedestrian facilities could be improved, and where pedestrian collisions occurred over an 11-year period. It forecasted changes in pedestrian demand due to Expo Light Rail. The Pedestrian Action Plan includes a target for reducing and ultimately eliminating fatal and severe roadway collisions, internationally known as Vision Zero, a priority expressed by Council in March 2015.  The Bike Action Plan was adopted in November 2011, to guide City efforts to get people onto bikes, to promote safe bicycling, to encourage effective collaboration with community partners, and to help the City compete successfully for grant funding. The Bike Action Plan called for an increase in bicycling from 3% of trips to 14-35% by 2030. The Plan outlined five- and twenty-year goals for implementation of programs (education, awareness, events, and enforcement), creating support facilities (bike parking, bike centers), and construction/improvement of bikeways. With aggressive mode share targets, the Plan sought to make bicycling fun for everyone, as well as convenient and comfortable through a range of physical facilities and activities. The Bike Action Plan was the first implementation effort of the LUCE focused on creating complete streets that welcome pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders and drivers.   Discussion Each year since 2013 staff has prepared a Bike Action Plan implementation report for the Planning Commission. This year a joint report on the Pedestrian and Bike Action Plans was prepared and presented with an overall mobility update at the March 1, 2017 meeting (see Attachment A). With the opening of Expo Light Rail, the Colorado Esplanade and California Incline, service changes from Big Blue Bus and growth of Breeze Bike Share, there was a lot to report. Pursuit of the Councils Strategic Goal for a new model of mobility along with continued implementation of plans and projects brought a new enthusiasm for mobility and particularly bicycling and walking citywide.  Important as this Strategic Goal is to the Council and the community, it is one of many competing for capital investment, staff time and public engagement. There are vocal advocates for each mode of transportation (including, especially, the automobile). Remaking the street network to equalize access and promote shared usage and safety requires not only substantial financial commitment, but equally substantial commitment to ongoing management, public engagement and education -- as well as the political will to take the long view of change in the face of vigorous defense of the status quo when it comes to street design, parking policy and traffic enforcement. So far in 2017, Santa Monica has seen an unusual spike in pedestrian-involved collisions. Some have resulted in severe injury and fatality. When a person is killed or severely injured it affects families and friends, neighbors, employers and many others. That is one reason why the Council adopted a target to reduce and ultimately eliminate roadway fatalities and severe injuries. Santa Monica joined in this relatively new movement of Vision Zero cities with adoption of the Pedestrian Action Plan that defines a ten-year target. Walking is a part of the Santa Monica culture, along with being part of a compassionate community that wants to be informed and responsible, and to enjoy roadways that provide attractive and comfortable environments for everyone. This report shares some baseline data and shares best practices for Vision Zero from other cities. Vision Zero was adopted in the Pedestrian Action Plan, but Vision Zero is a movement to protect everyone on the road regardless of what mode they are taking today. The numbers of pedestrian-involved collisions nationwide has grown to 15%, up from 11% in 2006. In California, pedestrians continue to make up 25% of all roadway deaths, even though numbers fell slightly in 2016. While the City of Los Angeles does not have citywide data for pedestrian-involved collisions this year, the Los Angeles Times recently published findings that collisions are up 43% from 2015 to 2016 in the City of Los Angeles, with similar trend data for 2017 thus far. The recent spate of both fatal and injury incidents involving cars and pedestrians appears to be part of a larger pattern of vehicle/pedestrian collisions observed nationwide.  Data AnalysisTraffic incident reports are taken by the Police Department for any crash with reported injury (including complaint of pain). The California Highway Patrol consolidates reports from all statewide agencies into a publicly-available database called the Statewide Integrated Traffic Reporting System (SWITRS). Historic collision data from these reports can begin to tell a story about the patterns and possible causes of collisions. A long view of many years can reveal patterns that may not appear when the sample sizes are smaller and over shorter timeframes. Three levels of data were reviewed for this staff report to begin to understand trends, and as a baseline for future detailed investigation as the Vision Zero program develops.         Police Department records of all reported collision and citations from January 1, 2013 to April 26, 2017          SWITRS records of all reported collisions from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2016         Pedestrian Action Plan analysis of SWITRS and Police Department reported collisions 2001-2011  Crash FrequencyOverall, the City of Santa Monica has seen a slight decrease in crash frequency since 2013, the first year that California law changed its reporting system and removed a mandate that required agencies to take reports at the scene of all incidents. Since the law was passed, agencies like SMPD are only required to take a report if there was an injury involved (including complaint of pain). For consistency in reporting, 2013 was chosen as the date to begin the data analysis. Just over 1,500 traffic incidents were reported in Santa Monica in 2013. It dropped to approximately 1,400 in 2014 and has remained stable through 2015 and 2016.   The SWITRS database records severity of injury for all parties. From 2006 to 2016, SWITRS data show 285 total fatal and severe injuries in Santa Monica, or an average of 26 per year. Year over year, the fewest fatalities and severe injuries were reported in 2010 with 20, and the highest was 37 in 2011. At least one fatality occurs each year, with a peak reported of six fatalities in three of the study years.   Vehicles are the only parties in 82% of traffic incidents. Incidents involving people walking and biking are 8% and 10% respectively. Of the severe injuries reported in SWITRS, people walking and driving each represent approximately 40%, with people bicycling making up most of the remaining 20% of severe injuries. Of reported fatalities, people walking are 62%, while people in vehicles are 28% and bicyclists are 8%. People driving motorcycles are 1% of severe injuries, and 3% of fatalities.  People walking and biking make up 60% of severe injuries and 70% of fatalities. This means they are many times more likely to killed or severely injured if involved in a collision, which is why they are sometimes referred to as having higher vulnerability or exposure on the roadway. Time and DayThe time of day is an important factor in the incidence of collisions, because it relates to daylight levels, traffic patterns, traffic volumes and other patterns of behavior. The highest number of all collisions occurred between 4:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. which is also a period of high activity. Residents take trips in almost equal amounts in the morning (8:00 a.m.) and evening (6:00 p.m.), according to the 2016 Resident Travel Survey, but severe injury crashes are more frequent in the evening. Fatal incidents have a less clear trend, but maintain a consistent level after 7:00 p.m. when other severe injury crashes are falling.   While there were no large differences between days of the week, Monday and Wednesday experience the highest number of traffic fatalities and severe injuries, and Friday has the lowest. No noticeable increase is seen weekends which tend to be busier in the Downtown and Beach areas.  Involved PartiesThe distribution of all fatal and severe injury crashes roughly follows the population distribution, except for young adults. People ages 15-24 make up approximately 9% of the population, but almost 16% of overall fatalities and severe injuries. However the distribution shifts for walking incidents, in which older age groups are over-represented among those killed or severely injured. People aged 55-64 make up 12.6% of the population, but 23% of walking incidents, and people aged 75-84 are 4.7% of the population and 11% of people killed or severely injured walking.   Geographical Analysis, 2013-2017 (YTD)Incidents are happening throughout Santa Monica, but trends mirror the findings of the Pedestrian Action Plan. As the following incident maps illustrate, major intersections and thoroughfares that have the highest volume of traffic also have the highest rates of collisions. The sheer number of pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles traveling on Wilshire Boulevard, Santa Monica Boulevard, Pico Boulevard, Ocean Avenue, and other main streets creates additional exposure. When two main streets intersect, such as the case at Ocean Park Boulevard and Lincoln Boulevard, and in higher activity areas like downtown, the maps show the expected hot spots.     As it pertains to traffic education and enforcement, the Santa Monica Police Department has maintained a balanced position on allocating resources to these identified areas, focusing in areas with higher concentrations of collisions.  Primary Collision FactorsCrash incident reports provide twenty-two options for categorizing the primary cause of the collision, Primary Collision Factors (PCF), selected by the officer taking the report. Options range from unsafe speed to right of way violations and falling asleep. The Santa Monica Police Department has been evaluating data in order to determine appropriate areas in which to dedicate resources. The purpose of such analytics is to ensure the Police Department is distributing efforts in the best possible manner. Overall, the Police Department citation issuance is on par with the appropriate primary collision factors in the impacted areas throughout the City of Santa Monica.  As can be seen from year to year, the primary collision factors have rotated from Unsafe Speed/Inattentiveness to Unsafe Turning Movements. Those two primary collision factors account for a majority of all citations issued from year to year by the Police Department. Right of Way violations such as drivers/bicyclists failing to yield for pedestrians will continue to be an area of focus but the data set presents itself as a tertiary collision factor.  Below is a snapshot of all traffic collisions and citations issued citywide from year to year:  In the 2006-2016 SWITRS data, the top primary causes reported for all collisions resulting in fatal and severe injuries were:         Violation of Pedestrian right of way (16%)         Unsafe Speed (12%)         Pedestrian Violation (12%)         Violation of Automobile right of way (12%)         Driving Under the Influence (10%) High vehicle speeds are especially concerning as they limit driver reaction time which limits the ability to avoid unexpected conditions or behaviors which do happen. Speed also increases the severity of injury when crashes do occur, especially for people outside of vehicles. In those cases, the chances of fatality from a crash at 30 miles per hour is 45% but at 20 miles per hour it drops to 5%. SWITRS records also indicate fault for each collision. For collisions involving a pedestrian, pedestrians were assigned fault in 22% of incidents and bicyclists were assigned fault in 42% of collisions involving a bicyclist.     The Pedestrian Action Plan included a comprehensive analysis of ten years of crash data from 2001-2010. Consistent with findings from the Pedestrian Action Plan, recent crashes are occurring on the busiest streets, which have the most people as well as the highest speeds, and seniors continue to be disproportionately involved in the collisions. Santa Monica averaged 100 reported pedestrian-involved collisions a year during the evaluation period. Over the ten years of data, most pedestrians were walking legally in the right-of-way when they were hit by a vehicle. Other findings from this data analysis include: Seniors and young children are more susceptible to fatal and severe injury collisions both because of the higher likelihood they will be walking rather than driving, and because they are physically vulnerable.  Two-thirds of the pedestrians involved in collision were in a crosswalk. Typically, when a pedestrian is at fault in a collision it is the result of crossing outside a crosswalk. 50% of motorists who hit a pedestrian are proceeding straight, followed by making a left turn (22%) or a right turn (20%). The percent of people driving straight immediately before hitting a pedestrian increases to 64% at unsignalized intersections.  50% of reported crashes occur at signalized intersections.  80% of crashes occur on weekdays, and 35% occur between 3-7pm regardless of day. Vision ZeroVision Zero is rooted in the belief that protection of life, health and safety is a civic priority shared by all roadway users. Santa Monica recently joined an international Vision Zero community by prioritizing its implementation as the primary goal in the Pedestrian Action Plan adopted in 2016, seeking to eliminate preventable deaths and severe injuries that result from traffic collisions within the next ten years. Key elements of Vision Zero initiatives include:  Project design: define and construct projects to improve the safety for people using the street.  Operations: implement operational changes to reduce vehicle speeds that threaten pedestrian and bike safety. Programs: support programs that educate people walking, biking and driving. Behavior and Enforcement: encourage safe behaviors for all road users and enforce distracted driving violations, speeding, etc.  Walkability: promote walkable environments for people and activities. Santa Monica shares these Vision Zero target elements with dozens of other cities, including Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Chicago, Portland and smaller cities like San Mateo and Santa Barbara. Many of these large and small cities have written and adopted a comprehensive Vision Zero strategy.  Traffic safety is a value and priority of all Santa Monicans. Multiple City departments throughout the year strive to make the roads safe, encourage people to be alert, and educate the public about the rules of the road. Independently many departments work to achieve roadway safety by implementing departmental work plans. For instance, Public Works implements extensive annual street and sidewalk maintenance, repair and repaving, and maintains street lights. Planning and Community Developments Mobility Division works to realize the programmatic and infrastructure goals of the Bike Action Plan and Pedestrian Action Plan, which are discussed in detail later in this report. PCD also maintains traffic signals, pedestrian signals, and roadway signs.  The Santa Monica Police Departments Traffic Division has engaged in a variety of traffic education and enforcement operations. Efforts range from driving under the influence (DUI) checkpoints and saturation patrols, traffic enforcement operations, motorcycle safety operations, distracted driving, bicycle/pedestrian safety operations, public service announcements, social media, community meetings and interdepartmental collaboration. Officers conduct traffic safety presentations at WISE, local schools, and community events to provide traffic safety tips. The City also broadcasts via traditional and social media outlets a variety of public safety announcements on pedestrian safety, distracted driving, and other related topics. Traffic safety awareness messages are routinely posted on the Police Departments and City of Santa Monicas Facebook and Twitter pages. See Attachment B for details on Police Department enforcement, education and outreach and links to recent safety videos. Coordination of the existing efforts done by many City departments and divisions into a unifying framework with Vision Zero as a performance target would leverage these investments toward greater community health and wellbeing.   Achieving Vision ZeroThe Vision Zero Network is an inter-agency collaboration that shares best practices and information in this new field. Cities post their completed vision zero action plans, as well as practices for expanding the reach of safety efforts. Since the Vision Zero target was just recently adopted in the City of Santa Monica, we can learn from other agencies and begin to implement Vision Zero modeled on the best practices from other lead cities. Recommend actions to achieve Vision Zero include:          Build and sustain leadership. In New York and Los Angeles, elected Mayors released vision zero calls to action: Mayor Bill DiBlasio, Mayor Eric Garcetti. This includes consensus and commitment among local leadership. Sustain leadership with long-term goals and a strong sense of urgency to implement forward-facing communications as well as long-term investments and changes in practice. Some Vision Zero efforts may not yield results immediately so consistency is crucial.          Create a Task Force for interagency collaboration. New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles have all created task forces with roles for transportation, public safety, public health, public works, elected and appointed leaders, community partners, and outreach specialists. A Vision Zero coordinator is appointed to run the task force as a catalytic hub of coordination to insert Vision Zero into on-going departmental work, and to establish accountability for performance. Los Angeles incentivized interdepartmental collaboration through the budgeting process.         Develop and adopt a Vision Zero Action Plan. The plan should address specific, measureable and realistic actions. The plan will need to address street design practices, enforcement, education, evaluation, and equity. Some examples of action plans that can serve as starting points include: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle.          Change design practices and invest in roadway redesign for greater protection.  Los Angeles defined a high-injury street network of roadways prioritized for design changes and speed management to reduce the severity of injuries when crashes occur. Elected officials and other leaders need to courageously lead efforts for street design and operations that prioritize safety and manage speeds, even when resistance arises due to non-safety concerns such as parking and large vehicle access. Los Angeles is currently pursuing investing all of the Measure M Local Return funds into Vision Zero projects.         Create an interagency communication and education campaign for Vision Zero. Most programs develop an outreach and education strategy at the front end using tools from behavior change theory. New York evaluated primary crash factors and created targeted marketing materials and communications to reverse those behaviors using high impact imagery and messages. Messages humanize the loss of life. Communications keep the issue at top of mind. In Seattle the safety resources combine print, and media ads for unified strategy.         Collect, Analyze and Use Data to inform action, and share it. Use a data-driven process for initial strategies as well as evaluation and adjustment. Boston and New York post online GIS maps with collision information, and Los Angeles has interactive maps of severe and fatal injuries collision data, including victim information. Austin is crowdsourcing public perceptions of safety. Most coordinators prepare annual or biennial report cards.The City Councils commitment to Vision Zero is an important starting point for action, including communicating the need for responsible action among everyone on the road. As a compassionate community, it is imperative that we all look out for one another at all times. While it is impossible to predict what the remainder of the year will bring, taking responsibility on the road by being attentive and careful is the first and most important step."}, "title": " Council review and comment on Vision Zero, Bike Action Plan and Pedestrian Action Plan implementation.", "Sponsors": null, "recommendations": ["Vision Zero, Bike Action Plan and Pedestrian Action Plan implementation to provide policy direction on priorities for achieving the Councils Strategic Goal of creating a new model of mobility in Santa Monica."], "Department": "Mobility (PCD)"}], [], [], [{"Category": "07. Ordinances", "body": {"other": "Over the last year and a half staff has convened regular meetings and solicited a significant amount of public input to assist with the development of this ordinance. Stakeholders have included the Water Neutrality Stakeholder Committee (Stakeholder Committee) which is comprised of representatives of water agencies, non-governmental organizations, sustainability consultants, architects, developers, manufacturers, engineers, plumbers, Los Angeles County; the Citys Water Advisory Committee; and staff from the Public Works Department, Planning and Community Development Department, and the City Attorneys Office. Based on the input received from these groups, staff is recommending the proposed water neutrality ordinance (Attachment B) that would: 1) Require new developments to be as water-efficient as possible through the design and installation of the most water-saving plumbing fixtures and/or non-potable water systems including graywater, rainwater harvesting, blackwater systems, and municipally supplied recycled/non-potable water (such as water from the Santa Monica Urban Runoff Recycling Facility (SMURRF)). 2) If compliance cannot be met after all practical water-saving devices and systems are included in the design, the developer would be required to cover the costs to offset the water at an offsite location through the Citys turn-key retrofit program and/or perform retrofits at self-selected sites at their own cost and risk. 3) The Citys initial turn-key retrofit program would include an Administration Fee and In-lieu Fee to cover the costs to implement and retrofit existing properties with water-saving toilets, urinals, showerheads, faucet aerators and/or other permanent water saving measures. 4) Affordable housing would receive a credit. Instead of a 1:1 ratio for water offsets, 100% affordable housing new development projects would be required to meet a 0.5:1 offset ratio. 5) Replace the Water Demand Mitigation Ordinance, effective March 1, 2018.Paths to ComplianceApplicability - New DevelopmentEffective March 1, 2018, this ordinance would apply to new developments which include new buildings with plumbing fixtures; existing buildings with plumbing fixtures where 50% or more of the exterior walls or principal structural supports are demolished; and new or enlarged swimming pools, spas, water features, and ponds. This would not apply to a new garage that has no plumbing fixtures, a kitchen or bath remodel or an addition that does not require the removal of 50% or more of the exterior walls/structural supports.  Recent data shows between 60 to 100 projects per year (with an average of 72) would be required to comply with the ordinance, including City projects. Seventy-six percent of these projects were single-family new developments. Since 2014, more than 150 new swimming pools were permitted.  Building DesignWhen a new development applicant applies for the initial building permit. Staff would notify the applicant of the water neutrality ordinance, as the entire design could be impacted by this requirement. The City would provide the applicant with the existing propertys five-year average water use. This would be the baseline to compare projected new water demand. Where no water data is available, the baseline would be the five-year average of properties in the same customer class with the same meter size (example: single-family home with a one-inch meter). Five-years was chosen to reflect water use demands where varying occupancy, tenancy, and climate affects could be accounted for and averaged. Using only the most recent year or two could show a major shift in usage such as vacancy or severe water shortage restrictions, which would significantly impact the offset requirement. The baseline for water neutrality is completely separate from baselines used to establish water use allowances as part of the Water Shortage Response Plan. Staff is also recommending a new program to provide technical design assistance to help applicants achieve water neutrality. This was a specific request from the Stakeholder Committee to help designers select new technologies that they may not be aware of or have never specified in a project which would help them achieve compliance with the ordinance. The estimated $425,000 for five-years would pay for a consultant to review preliminary concepts and/or plans, provide recommendations for water-saving technologies, and direct the designer to additional resources and/or funding opportunities. Some technologies save both water and energy such as efficient showerheads, cooling towers, and recirculating hot water systems. The Citys technical design assistance program would work in coordination with the existing Southern California Edison (SCE) and the Gas Companys Savings by Design Program, which, currently, tier 1 and tier 2 projects are required to utilize to achieve energy savings and receive financial incentives. The technologies recommended by both programs would be consistent for those products that save both water and energy. The SCE and Gas Company Savings by Design Program is funded by the California Public Utility Commission (CPUC). City staff tried to expand upon the SCE and Gas Company to include water saving fixtures but they cannot add devices that only save water at this time due to CPUC regulations. Funding for the Citys new technical design assistance program is included in the FY 2017-19 Proposed Operating Budget.  Projected New Water DemandIn order to standardize the projected water demand from a new development, a water demand calculator would be made available online to assist in the design of new developments and to show comparisons of projected water demand based on different plumbing fixtures, non-potable water systems, and landscaping choices. A water demand spreadsheet would be created by this calculator and would be used as part of the building plan set submission. The City and County of San Francisco has authorized the City to use its existing water demand calculator. Staff, in partnership with the Stakeholder Committee and the vendor selected to implement the offset program, would adapt this calculator to meet local conditions and current plumbing codes in Santa Monica. At the time of implementation, the calculator would provide sufficient data for the majority of new single-family and mixed-used development projects. The calculator would include the water use for toilets, urinals, showers, faucets, climate control systems, landscaping, pools, spas, water features, and ponds. Water benchmarking data, water usage data for specific types of water using devices for residents and businesses, is almost non-existent. Currently, the calculator is limited to water usage for only a few fixtures that have data such as toilets, urinals, and faucets. The calculator would evolve as more data becomes available for how much water various fixtures use in specific types of buildings, e.g. hair salon hair washing stations or restaurant dishwashers for a 30-seat capacity full service restaurant. In the future if a new full-service restaurant with 30 seats used the calculator, it would provide the projected demand for all the water using fixtures onsite such as for food-prep, thawing food, dishwashing, and cleaning in addition to toilets, urinals, and faucets. Plan CheckOnce developers decide on a final design, they would submit the new water demand spreadsheets to the Office of Sustainability and the Environment for review and approval. If a new development is designed to use no more water than the previous propertys five-year average, the projects new water demand plan would be approved and no additional requirements would be applied. In-lieu OffsetsIf a new development is designed with all practical water-savings measures and additional water demand is still projected, the project would not be considered in compliance with the water neutrality regulations and would be required to offset the additional projected water use.  Offsets would be achieved by retrofitting devices and plumbing fixtures like toilets, urinals, showerheads, and faucet aerators in an existing property located in Santa Monica. The number and type of retrofits would vary depending on the amount of water needed to offset each project. Developers would have the option of utilizing the Citys turn-key retrofit program and/or performing their own retrofits. For developer retrofits, the City would require approval of the devices and their corresponding water savings estimates in addition to permits and inspections for those installations. For the Citys program, toilets, showerheads, and faucet aerators would be installed initially and the Citys vendor would be responsible for inviting owners of existing properties to participate in the retrofit program. The vendor would also pre-screen buildings to ensure they meet the criteria for retrofitting. The Stakeholder Committee recommended a priority installation list where low-income multi-family apartments would be asked to participate first followed by high-water use multi-family apartment then low-income single-family homes, etc. Multi-family properties are easy to retrofit and have more residents than individual single-family homes, thus generating higher water-savings. Most single-family homes are likely to achieve compliance by installing very water-efficient fixtures and landscaping on-site to meet existing building code requirements. These new developments would be more water-efficient than previous homes. However, installing a pool where one did not exist before or adding several new bathrooms as part of the new development project could require offsets somewhere else in the city. The proposed water neutrality ordinance is drafted to allow for flexibility in the design of water-efficient buildings in order to meet compliance. These are new technologies that may not be approved by the Los Angeles Department of Public Health and/or the State Water Resources Control Board at this time for installation in certain buildings such as graywater for toilet flushing in an apartment building. These agencies are developing a permitting process for a variety of new water-saving technologies and installation locations.  Administrative and In-lieu FeesWhen an applicant is required to offset additional water use an Administrative Fee would be assessed. Additionally, if the applicant chooses to participate in the Citys turn-key retrofit program an In-lieu Fee would be charged. The Administrative Fee covers the costs for administering the ordinance including coordination with the developer, maintenance of the projected water demand calculator, retrofit site selection, audits, inspections, data entry, and reporting. The In-lieu Fee covers the costs for the retrofit of water-saving fixtures elsewhere in the city. These two fees would cover the Citys costs to implement this ordinance and would not be refundable. The fees are based on the costs charged by a vendor to implement the water neutrality ordinance. The amount of the In-lieu Fee would be based upon the cost to achieve the necessary water savings generated by replacing existing toilets, showerheads, and faucet aerators. This includes the cost of the replacement fixtures and the cost to install them. In order to calculate the water savings, certain assumptions would be made such as occupancy rate (numbers provided by the Citys Planning Division), old and new fixture flow rates, duration of the flow or use, and per capita daily usage. The Stakeholder Committee agreed upon the formulas and assumptions included in the draft ordinance.  A request for proposals was issued on December 16, 2016 for the administration and implementation of the in-lieu offset retrofit program. Two bids were received, however, both bids were incomplete and not reviewed. The request for proposals was re-issued on January 24, 2017. Two bids were received and evaluated by staff. The costs provided by the top ranking vendor was used as the basis for the Administrative Fee and In-lieu Fee (see Attachment C for In-lieu Fee). Retrofits performed by the Citys vendor are subject to prevailing wage requirements. On July 11, 2017, staff will bring to Council a request to authorize negotiations with the top ranking vendor. Staff will also request for Council to set the plan check fee, inspection fee, the Administrative Fee, and the In-lieu Fee related to this ordinance as part of the annual fee schedule update on June 27, 2017.  The Administrative Fee would be a flat rate of $2,000 per project to be paid at the time of the building permit issuance. This Administrative Fee covers the cost of the vendor to help City staff implement this ordinance and it includes coordination with staff, the developer, maintaining the calculator, selecting and pre-screening the retrofit sites, verifying developer retrofits, reporting, and City prevailing wage reporting. The vendor could also provide plan check and inspection services if needed. Fifty percent of the In-lieu Fee would be paid at the time of the building permit issuance and the balance is to be paid at the time of the temporary certificate of occupancy or certificate of occupancy. Splitting the In-lieu Fee payment allows for adjustments in the design of the building that may need to be made during construction and that could impact the projected water demand. Changes to the buildings plan would require additional plan check and submission of a new water demand spreadsheet. Offset requirements could change along with In-lieu Fees. Fees already collected would not be reimbursed. RetrofitsOnce the fees are collected, the Citys vendor would arrange retrofits with pre-screened properties. The retrofits would target low income, high water use customers, and buildings where sewer capacity is higher than average. Once the eligible list of properties is retrofitted, staff would look for new opportunities to save water on private and public properties. The retrofits would include the removal of the old fixtures, replacement with new water-saving fixtures such as showerheads, toilets, faucet aerators, and the recycling of old fixtures when available. Recycling facilities do not accept used toilets and/or metals from used showerheads and faucets. Broken porcelain toilets can easily puncture tires or cause injury so many recycling facilities, including Allan and Company in Santa Monica, no longer accept them. The retrofit potential for toilets, showerheads, faucet aerators within existing buildings in Santa Monica is estimated at about 60,000 total fixture replacements. This is based on fixture replacement rates from previous retrofit programs between 1989 and 2003.  HardshipA hardship provision is included in the draft ordinance that waives the ordinance requirements if it can be demonstrated that the off-set requirement would deprive the owner of all economically beneficial use of that site or be prohibited by state or federal law. Estimated Costs to DevelopersThe examples below provide estimates of how the projected new water demand and off-sets would be calculated but do not show the actual demand and/or off-sets. The fees were calculated using the top ranking vendors cost proposal. Please note that the examples below are based on codes and standards used in the current online calculator developed by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission for buildings in San Francisco. Santa Monica will use this online calculator as a template and update the data based on the Committees decisions using local conditions and the current plumbing code requirements.  Single-family Home:Offset Requirement = 50,000 gallons per yearRetrofits Required for Offset = 21 fixtures (6 toilets, 5 showerheads, 10 faucet aerators) to be installed which would save 51,028 gallons per yearAdmin Fee: $2,000In-lieu Fee: $3,243Total: $5,243 ($0.10/gal saved) Mixed Use Development with 60 units:Offset Requirement = 722,553 gallons per yearRetrofits Required for Offset = 301 fixtures (76 toilets, 75 showerheads, 150 faucet aerators) saving 722,612 gallons per year to be installedAdmin Fee: $2,000In-lieu Fee: $43,983Total: $45,983 ($0.06/gal. saved) Effect on Other OrdinancesWater Shortage Response PlanWhen a water supply shortage is declared by City Council as a Stage 1, 2, 3, or 4, water use allowances go into effect. This requires mandatory conservation and water customers to reduce use by a set percentage from a prior years water usage. Currently, the City is in a Stage 2 Water Supply Shortage and water use allowances are in effect. Water customers that exceed their water use allowance are subject to fines and civil penalties. On May 23, 2017, staff will bring to Council an update to the Water Shortage Response Plan that would require the new developments new water demand to become the water use allowance during a declared water supply shortage. Using the approved water neutrality demand calculation as the water use allowance provides the most accurate water budget and would likely not result in a citation, adjustment or appeal. However, penalties could still be assessed for using more than the updated water use allowance. Water Demand Mitigation OrdinanceIf adopted, the water neutrality ordinance would replace the existing water demand mitigation ordinance (WDM), effective March 1, 2018, when the new water neutrality ordinance will be ready for full implementation. The existing water demand mitigation ordinance would automatically terminate on February 28, 2018.   The proposed water neutrality ordinance is designed to keep water levels at current levels and any offsets would be at a one-to-one ratio, except 100% affordable housing new development projects. Offset retrofits would be installed at private and/or public properties and would no longer be restricted to only City-owned properties. Water Neutrality CostsThe water neutrality ordinance would require funding totaling $2,647,728 million over five years. Of that total, an initial appropriation of $2,272,123 would be required to prepare it for implementation. Of the total $2,089,749 would be completely recouped, through newly-established fees, as new developments are approved and completed. The remaining $557,979 would fund a) professional services for software updates b) initial vendor costs for implementation and c) a Water Savings by Design technical design assistance program to help designers incorporate new and more water-efficient technologies to achieve compliance. The $595,000 would not be recoverable through fees. The professional service cost for development and implementation of the water neutrality ordinance over five years is $2,425,000. Non-reimbursable up-front costs include a) $100,000 in professional services to upgrade the existing database software system to track new developments and retrofits and b) $70,000 for a new vendor to initiate the implementation of the ordinance, update the water demand calculator, and setup the retrofit program and c) the Water Savings by Design technical design assistance program would cost $425,000 over a five-year period and is non-reimbursable. The $1,830,000 for offset retrofits would be reimbursed through the collection of Administration and In-lieu Fees. $250,000 was included in the Water Rates 5-year forecast for these up-front costs Staff will return to Council on July 11, 2017 with a recommendation for the modification to the existing contract with ConserveTrack, LLC for the database software system upgrades and a new contract with DNV GL Energy Services USA, Inc. for the administration of the water neutrality ordinance. OSE is also requesting one existing Water Resources position be deleted and replaced with one Sustainability Analyst position. The Sustainability Analyst would spend 20% of his/her time implementing water neutrality. The other 80% of his/her time would be spent implementing water conservation programs related to water shortage response and water self-sufficiency. The total staff cost for five-years is $122,728. Water neutrality plan check and inspection fees collected would total $159,749 cover the staff costs to implement this ordinance.  Water neutrality implementation would include managing the contract with the vendor, educating the public about the ordinance, and providing plan check and inspections for water neutrality projects. The work associated with water shortage response and water self-sufficiency include implementing the water use allowance citations, providing water school for water use allowance citations, providing water use consultations and other water conservation related tasks as requested. Should the water supply shortage be rescinded and water use allowances end, this Sustainability Analyst could take on the administrative tasks assigned to the vendor implementing the water neutrality ordinance. The position is requested as part of the FY 2017-19 Operating Budget. TimelineUpon Council approval of this ordinance by resolution, award of the proposed contracts, and contract execution (estimated to take between four to six months), staff would continue to meet with the Stakeholder Committee to finalize the implementation plan and implement the projected water demand calculator. Staff would also provide outreach and education to homeowners and professionals about the ordinance and develop the technical design assistance program, if funded. Full implementation of the ordinance would occur on March 1, 2018. At that time those applicants pulling a first application would be subject to the ordinance. Those applicants that have already pulled a first application, are in the entitlement process, submitted plans, or received a building permit before March 1, 2018 would not be subject to compliance with this ordinance. For those applicants/permit holders, retroactive compliance with the ordinance would require significant design review, changes to the project and signifcant additional costs.  Below is the projected timeline for implementation of the proposed water neutrality ordinance: OutreachFive Stakeholder Committee Meetings were held on November 15, 2016; December 12, 2016; January 24, 2017; March 8, 2017; and April 4, 2017; where proposed requirements of the ordinance and its implementation were discussed and a consensus on recommendations was achieved. Staff presented the draft ordinance to the Chamber of Commerce Governmental Affairs Committee on March 6, 2017. A public meeting was held on April 6, 2017 and 10 community members attended. Staff also presented the draft ordinance to the North of Montana Association (NOMA) neighborhood association on April 6, 2017 and at the Mid-Cities neighborhood association on April 18, 2017. The public was notified by emails sent to all the neighborhood groups and business districts, Facebook postings, a press release, and a calendar event listed on the Citys website. Information about the ordinance and how to comply will be posted on the Citys website prior to implementation. Water Advisory CommitteeStaff presented the draft ordinance to the Citys Water Advisory Committee on February 6, 2017. Following discussion, the committee recommended support of the ordinance. Task Force on the EnvironmentStaff presented the draft ordinance to the Citys Task Force on the Environment on March 20, 2017. Following discussion, the Task Force unanimously approved a motion in support of the ordinance. If adopted staff would provide additional outreach and education to architects, landscape architects, neighborhood groups, business districts, and the community at large. On November 24, 2015, staff presented City Council with three options to develop and implement a water neutrality ordinance. Council chose one option and directed staff to return with an ordinance. The proposed water neutrality ordinance attached is based on Councils directions. An alternative to this proposed ordinance is to keep the existing Water Demand Mitigation Fee in place and not approve the proposed water neutrality ordinance. Future year costs of $2,272,123 and new revenues are included in the FY 2017-19 Proposed Budget and are contingent on Council budget approval.  ", "background": "On November 24, 2015, Council directed staff to develop a water neutrality ordinance with the intent to keep the citys total water demand from increasing as a result of new development (Attachment A). Council directed staff to prepare an ordinance that would require 1) new developments to stay within the same water use as the existing property through the installation of water-efficient fixtures and systems; 2) provide an In-lieu Fee option if compliance could not be met; and 3) provide a credit for affordable housing. Council also directed that implementation of an offsite retrofit program funded by In-lieu Fees be provided by City staff and/or a vendor. ", "summary": "In response to Councils November 24, 2015 directive, staff has drafted a water neutrality ordinance. This ordinance would help Santa Monica achieve the goal of becoming water self-sufficient by 2020 through limiting the citys water demand. The ordinance would not allow a new development to exceed the water use of the existing development on that property. If that requirement could not be met onsite, the excess water demand would have to be offset by reducing the water demand (through fixture replacement) at another site within the city. The water neutrality ordinance would require funding totaling $2,647,728 million over five years. Of that total, an initial appropriation of $2,272,123 would be required to prepare it for implementation. Of this total $2,089,749 would be completely recouped, through newly-established fees, as new developments are approved and completed. The remaining $557,979 would fund a technical design assistance program to help designers incorporate new and more water-efficient technologies to achieve compliance, software updates to administer the program, and initial costs to setup the program.

Ordinances", "body": {"other": "The proposed modifications to the Urban Runoff Pollution Control Ordinance update the requirements for new and re-development projects to install post-construction structural devices to collect stormwater for treatment and use, keeping pollutants out of the Santa Monica Bay and promoting local water use and conservation.  The modified Ordinance implements new requirements associated with the 2012 NPDES permit.The objectives of the Ordinance changes are to significantly reduce environmental impacts related to urban runoff and to increase sustainable practices in land use design and local water resource management.  The Ordinance promotes Low Impact Development land use design strategies and Green Infrastructure structural solutions. These strategies and solutions emphasize using land area to retain onsite rainwater for beneficial uses, reduce the need for municipal drinking water for non-drinking purposes, and allow the land to treat low levels of runoff pollution associated with roof runoff. These changes also ensure the City conforms to the 2012 NPDES Permit, helping the City avoid any financial penalties. The major revisions to Chapter 7.10 are summarized below:       Definitions Section: Updates, clarifies and adds definitions      Good Housekeeping Requirements Section: Updates and expands activities required to prevent polluted runoff and comply with the new NPDES permit      Runoff Reduction and Post-Construction Best Management Practices (BMPs) Requirements Section: Updates this section to focus more efficiently and broadly on Low Impact Development and Green Infrastructure strategies to remove pollutants from stormwater. New paragraphs are added to promote local water supply, e.g. rainwater, in lieu of imported water, increase vigilance and enforcement for litter prevention, and avoid infiltrating strategies in areas compromising safety, such as the bluffs and known contaminated soils areas.o       A new section for large parcels, equal to or greater than 15,000 square feet, mandating storage of rainwater in tanks for direct indoor and outdoor uses, such as toilet and urinal flushing, and irrigation;o       A new section on property transfer documentation that discloses to new owners the presence and required annual maintenance for existing onsite rainwater harvesting systems; and,o       A more precise and prescriptive description of the requirements for annual maintenance of the propertys post-construction BMP system. New ordinance language and definitions expand options for customers to comply with the post-construction BMP requirement, allowing improved compliance by customers and by the City. Ordinance changes require properties to implement good housekeeping practices to protect the Santa Monica Bay. This includes new language for more effective and comprehensive oversight to reduce urban runoff pollution associated with trash and debris containment, water feature discharges, equipment maintenance, and surface parking areas for existing properties. Changes to mandate rainwater harvesting on limited large parcels would increase local water supplies and contribute to the goals established in the Citys Sustainable Water Master Plan. Lastly, new language requires customers to accept responsibility for BMP maintenance and operations as recorded covenants that run with the land and to report annually on BMP maintenance and operations in order to extend the life of BMPs, reduce costly corrections, and improve pollution removal and treatment. The revised Ordinance requires that an applicant must meet urban runoff mitigation requirements through the use of onsite low impact development (LID) BMPs.  If the applicant demonstrates that onsite LID BMPs are infeasible, they will be allowed to meet the requirements through the use of LID BMPs at an approved offsite location.  Traditional treat and release BMPs are no longer an option for meeting the urban runoff mitigation requirements. Staff from relevant City departments, including: Public Works, Planning and Community Development, and the Office of Sustainability and the Environment would have a role in implementation.  The proposed changes would bring clarity to the enforcement process and allow for more efficient and effective compliance with the NPDES Permit requirements. Implementation of the proposed Ordinance changes related to post-construction BMP design requirements, inspections and installation would occur through the existing plan check process and the associated plan checkers. No significant change in the plan check process is anticipated. The public would be informed of Ordinance changes through existing education and outreach activities related to construction planning and permitting, enforcement outreach and notification, and City community events. Stakeholder Outreach The revised Urban Runoff Pollution Control Ordinance was presented to the Santa Monica Task Force on the Environment on June 20, 2016 and the Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce on October 13, 2016 for review and comment.  The Santa Monica Task Force on the Environment discussed the update to the ordinance, highlighting the importance of keeping pollutants out of the Santa Monica Bay while promoting local water use and conservation. The Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce Land Use Committee discussed the impacts on local land use design and water resource management. ", "background": "In 1972 the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) was created in Section 402 of the Clean Water Act. \"NPDES prohibits [discharges] of pollutants from any point source into the nation's waters except as allowed under an NPDES permit.\" The program gives the EPA the authority to regulate discharges into the nation's waters by setting limits on the effluent that can be introduced into a body of water from an operating and permitted facility. In 1987 Congress also passed the Water Quality Act, which called for increased monitoring and assessing of water bodies to ensure that water quality standards were not just on paper, but were actually being realized in the nation's waters. The EPA authorized the NPDES permit program to state, tribal, and territorial governments, enabling them to perform many of the permitting, administrative, and enforcement aspects of the NPDES program themselves. Currently 46 states, including California through the State Water Resources Control Board and the nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards are authorized to implement the NPDES program.In 1990, regulations for discharges from a municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) for the NDPES permit were finalized by the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board (Board), and the first 5-year NPDES permit was issued to Los Angeles County. The goal was to reduce runoff pollution entering the waters of the United States through basic water pollution control practices, such as street sweeping, catch basin cleaning, hazardous waste facility inspection, and public education, which the City was doing in part. In 1992, in a forward-thinking move to go beyond the basic requirements of the first NPDES permit, the City established SMMC 7.10 to control runoff pollution associated with dry weather runoff, wet weather (stormwater), construction site activities, and daily activities on existing parcels (good house-keeping practices). This ordinance helped the City comply with the 1990 NPDES permit, as well as meet the goals of the Citys Sustainable City Plan regarding natural resources and pollution reduction. In 1996, the second NPDES permit was adopted by the Board with no major changes. In late 2000, with the expected approval of the third NPDES Permit, SMMC 7.10 was updated to incorporate a new requirement of the third NPDES permit, which was adopted in early 2001 - increasing the rainfall collection numerical standard of onsite, structural post-construction Best Management Practice. In 2007, the fourth NPDES permit was approved by the Board. No major changes were made. In 2010, City Council introduced for first reading an amended ordinance to update and modify Chapter 7.10, Urban Runoff Pollution Control, per Attachment A.  These updates were based upon City recommendations to improve sustainable use of local water resources, not upon regionally-imposed requirements. On December 28, 2012, the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board approved the 2012 NPDES permit. The 2012 permit significantly expanded the scope of stormwater management by requiring onsite harvesting, treatment, and use of precipitation before it otherwise runs off to the municipal storm drain system and drains into the Bay, carrying numerous pollutants and resulting in violations of various Clean Water Act standards. This was a shift from the previous regional strategy of stormwater treatment and release to Santa Monica Bay. Prior to the 2012 updates, the Citys existing Ordinance focused on onsite harvesting and minimized the emphasis on treat and release, resulting in minimal change to the management strategy within the Ordinance. After adoption of the 2012 NPDES permit, cities were given a multi-year timetable to develop Enhanced Watershed Management Plans (EWMPs).  EWMPs are comprehensive watershed plans and hydrology analyses that comply with the permit requirements.  These were submitted to the Board for its approval in 2016. The City, working with its watershed municipal partners, such as Los Angeles, complied with all deadlines. ", "summary": "The Runoff Pollution Mitigation Ordinance, SMMC 7.10, is the legal instrument used by Santa Monica to reduce runoff pollution entering Santa Monica Bay. The modifications to this ordinance presented for Council consideration would significantly reduce environmental impacts related to runoff and promote a stronger shift towards sustainability in land use design and in local water resource management. Specifically, the recommended changes would keep stormwater, a water pollution source, out of the Santa Monica Bay (Bay) and implement new requirements associated with the 2012 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Systems (NPDES) permit.

Public Hearings", "body": {"other": "SGMA provides GSAs with a broad array of new authorities. For example, it provides local GSAs with the authority to conduct investigations, determine the sustainable yield of a groundwater basin, measure and limit extractions, impose fees for groundwater management, and enforce the terms of a Groundwater Sustainability Plan (GSP).  Nothing in SGMA is to be construed as authorizing a local agency to make a binding determination of the water rights of any person or entity. In addition, SGMA states that nothing in a GSP supersedes the land use authority of cities and counties.  SGMA includes provisions to promote engagement by interested parties in the formation of a GSA and development and implementation of a GSP. GSAs must identify key parties and maintain records that spell out how their interests will be included in GSA operations and GSP development. SGMA requires the GSA to provide this information to the California Department of Water Resources. The GSA is the primary agency responsible for achieving sustainability within the mandated timeframe. The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act empowers local agencies to adopt groundwater management plans that are tailored to the resources and needs of their communities. Good groundwater management will provide a buffer against drought and climate change, and contribute to reliable water supplies regardless of weather patterns. For Santa Monica, development of a groundwater management plan for the entire Santa Monica Groundwater Basin provides an opportunity to enhance its stated objective to achieve water self-sufficiency through a collaborative effort with other local agencies overlying the basin.  Groundwater Sustainability Agency Formation SGMA promotes coordinated management of an entire groundwater basin. A map of the Santa Monica Groundwater Basin is provided in Attachment A. Any local agency or combination of local agencies overlying a groundwater basin may form a groundwater sustainability agency (GSA) for the basin. Attachment B provides a map of the local agencies overlying the Santa Monica Groundwater Basin. A combination of local agencies may form a GSA by joint powers agreement or memorandum of agreement or other legal agreement. Local agencies have until June 30, 2017 to form a GSA. The GSA applicant must notify the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) of the formation or establishment of a GSA within 30 days of final formation, and 90 days later the applicant shall be the exclusive GSA as long as no other local agency submits a notification of its intent to undertake groundwater management in all or a portion of the same area.  City of Santa Monica GSA InvolvementThe 50-square mile Santa Monica Groundwater Basin underlies Santa Monica and portions of Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and Culver City. In preparation for submitting GSA formation documents to the state Department of Water Resources by the June 30 deadline, City of Santa Monica staff, in concert with other agencies overlying the Santa Monica Basin, including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, City of Beverly Hills, Culver City, and the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works (collectively, \"the Parties\") has developed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for the creation of the Santa Monica Groundwater Basin GSA. The MOU is provided as Attachment C to this report.  The Parties have indicated a preference to have the City of Santa Monica serve as the point of contact on behalf of the Santa Monica Groundwater Basin GSA as well as the lead in undertaking other obligations of the GSA. Santa Monica is the appropriate lead agency for the GSA as the predominant groundwater pumper in the basin over the last 20-30 years. As the coordinating agency, Santa Monica would provide the single point of contact with the State, prepare and file annual reports as required by SGMA, administer service contracts, and coordinate the administrative functions of the GSA. Existing staff will perform these duties. The negotiating representatives intend to develop a unified GSP for the entire Santa Monica Groundwater Basin. The assignment of SGMA implementation duties (including data and cost sharing obligations) may be negotiated as part of the GSP. To date the powers and duties of the Parties, individually and collectively, including cost sharing, have yet to be fully negotiated so final decisions on these may be deferred until the GSP development process in order to expedite formation of the GSA.  Public Information MeetingSGMA statutes require that a GSA consider all interests of all beneficial uses and users of groundwater in the basin. This includes the interests of a variety of different stakeholders, including beneficial users of water, environmental interests, disadvantaged communities, tribes, and others. The agency must maintain a list of persons interested in receiving notices regarding plan preparation and other activities. Toward this end, a public information meeting was held on April 12, 2017 at Windward School in Mar Vista to provide potential stakeholders and interested parties an opportunity to become informed about SGMA requirements and status of local GSA formation efforts. A list of stakeholders notified of the meeting and those in attendance is included in Attachment D. The application for formation of the GSA must be submitted to the State Department of Water Resources by June 30, 2017. Included among the submittal requirements are resolutions from the each of the agencies forming the GSA and the fully executed MOU. The resolution attached herewith as Attachment E authorizes formation of the GSA and Santa Monicas participation therein, and the MOU is the governance document for the GSA. The May 9, 2017 Santa Monica City Council meeting serves as the required Public Hearing for Santa Monicas election to become part of a GSA for the Santa Monica Groundwater Basin. Notice of this public hearing was published in the Santa Monica Daily Press on April 25, 2017 and May 2, 2017. Similarly, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, City of Beverly Hills, City of Culver City, and Los Angeles County Department of Public Works have conducted Public Hearings. Copies of the multiple resolutions and the fully executed MOU will be submitted to the State Department of Water Resources by June 30, 2017. ", "summary": "The local water agencies of City of Santa Monica, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, City of Beverly Hills, City of Culver City, and Los Angeles County overly the Santa Monica Groundwater Basin. The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014 empowers local agencies to adopt groundwater management plans to ensure resilience for local water supplies. In order to comply with the requirements of the Act, these agencies have developed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to establish the Santa Monica Basin Groundwater Sustainability Agency to effectively manage groundwater in the Santa Monica Groundwater Basin. In order to meet the agency formation deadline of June 30, 2017, the fully executed MOU and resolutions acknowledging each local agencys participation in the agency must be submitted to the State Department of Water Resources. There is no immediate financial impact or budget action necessary as a result of the recommended action. Background On September 16, 2014, Governor Brown signed a package of three bills to advance sustainable groundwater management in California. The legislation, known as the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), provides a framework for improved management of groundwater by local authorities. The bills are SB 1168 (Pavley), SB 1319 (Pavley), and AB 1739 (Dickinson).  The legislation provides local agencies with the tools to manage groundwater basins in a sustainable manner over a long-term horizon and allows for limited state intervention when necessary to protect groundwater resources. SGMA establishes a definition of sustainable groundwater management, requires that local agencies develop groundwater management plans and implement strategies to sustainably manage groundwater resources, prioritizes basins with the greatest need (ranked as high and medium priority), and sets a timeline for implementation as follows:  June 30, 2017: Local Groundwater Sustainability Agencies (GSA) must be formed.  January 31, 2020: Groundwater Sustainability Plans (GSP) must be completed for basins in a critical condition of overdraft. January 31, 2022: GSPs must be completed in all other high- and medium-priority basins not currently in overdraft, including the Santa Monica Groundwater Basin. Twenty years after adoption of the GSP (2040 and 2042): All high- and medium-priority groundwater basins must achieve sustainability. The Santa Monica Groundwater Basin is categorized as a medium-priority basin.  The State prioritized groundwater basins utilizing eight specific criteria: overlying population, projected growth of overlying population, public supply wells, total number of wells, irrigated acreage overlying the basin, reliance on groundwater as the primary source of water, impacts on the groundwater, and other information deemed relevant by DWR."}, "title": " Santa Monica Basin Groundwater Sustainability Agency Memorandum of Understanding", "Sponsors": null, "recommendations": [" Hold a Public Hearing for the formation of a Groundwater Sustainability Agency for the Santa Monica Groundwater Basin;", " Adopt the attached resolution acknowledging the City of Santa Monicas election to become a Groundwater Sustainability Agency; and", " Authorize the City Manager to negotiate and execute a Memorandum of Understanding establishing the Santa Monica Basin Groundwater Sustainability Agency."], "Department": "Public Works, Water Resources"}], [], [{"Category": "11. Resolutions", "body": {"other": "The residents of Fourth Street between Strand Street and Hollister Avenue, and Fourth Street between Hollister Avenue and Ocean Park Boulevard have submitted complete petitions requesting to install preferential parking regulations. Residents of Strand Street between Fifth Street and Sixth Street currently located in Preferential Parking Zone U submitted a petition to change their current parking regulations from 2 hour parking 7AM-6PM Monday-Friday, except by permit to 2 hour parking 7AM-6PM daily, except by permit. The surrounding area includes:         to the east Preferential Parking Zone U 2 hour parking 7AM-6PM Monday-Friday, except by permit,           to the west Zone M No parking 10PM-2AM, 2 hour parking 9AM-10PM daily, except by permit, and           also to the west Zone I No parking 6PM-2AM, 2 hour parking 9AM-6PM daily, except by permit.  The existing area regulations and petition blocks are shown in Attachment B. Parking demand in the area is high due to its dense residential nature as well as its proximity to the successful business district on Main Street. A summary of peak parking occupancies is included as Attachment C. The summary is based on a parking survey conducted in August and September 2015 for both weekend and weekday time periods from 7 A.M. to 10 P.M., to capture both summer and Santa Monica High operations.          For both August and September for both the weekend and weekday parking occupancies on Fourth Street, Bay Street, and Pacific Street are near or above 85% occupancy between 7 A.M. and 10 P.M.           For both August and September for both the weekend and weekday Strand Street between Third Street and Sixth Street parking occupancies are near or above 85% occupancy except for the block between Fifth and Sixth Streets which has still high but lower parking occupancy during the morning.  The data indicates street parking is in high demand throughout the day and most residents may be required to circle the block to find a parking space near their residence. Community InputResidents, businesses, property owners, the neighborhood organization, and business districts of the area were notified of the proposed preferential parking zone by mail and invited to a June 23, 2016 community meeting to discuss preferential parking. A listing of the comments received at the meeting and in writing is included as Attachment D. A summary of the major issues stated at the meeting are listed below:         residents expressed a preference for regulations limiting overnight parking to residents and limited time parking for those without permits during the day;           residents expressed concern regarding employees working on Main Street parking all day on Fourth Street;            some residents preferred more restrictive all day regulations; and          some residents were opposed to any preferential parking regulations and voiced concerns regarding inconvenience, cost of parking permits, and difficultly for visitors to park.   Recommended Preferential Parking RegulationsBased on the parking occupancy study which showed high usage of street parking throughout the day and the community comments stating the difficulty of finding street parking and a desire for preferential parking, staff recommends approving the following preferential parking regulations for the following blocks:         Fourth Street between Pico Boulevard and Ocean Park Boulevard, and Strand Street, Pacific Street, and Bay Street between Third Street and Fourth Street with the regulation No parking 10 P.M. to 7 A.M., 2 hour parking 7 A.M. to 10 P.M., daily, except by permit, and          Strand Street between Sixth Street and Fourth Street with the regulation 2 hour parking 7 A.M. to 6 P.M. daily, except by permit.As the intention of preferential parking is to improve access to street parking for block residents and as the parking located on the Fourth Street median is adjacent to and frequently used by residents of Fourth Street staff recommends the proposed preferential parking regulations be applied to the parking located in the Fourth Street center medians. Hotchkiss Park is a community park that borders Strand Street and Fourth Street. Street parking along the curb immediately adjacent to the park would not be changed to maintain public parking access to the park. The Community and Cultural Services staff communicated they are not concerned about the proposed preferential parking regulations. Coastal ZoneThe preferential parking area is located within the Coastal Zone. Staff does not believe that the approval of the preferential parking area would require a Coastal Development Permit, as the City has made significant infrastructure investments to improve beach access. The City provides thousands of public parking spaces at the beach and has made significant investments to improve transit, pedestrian, and bicycle access to the beach. Thus, staff does not believe the establishment of preferential parking Zone RR or modification of Zone U would adversely impact public access to the beach. However, a Coastal Development Permit will be obtained if required by law. .  . Staff will inform Council if the Coastal Commission believes that a Coastal Development permit is required. AlternativesThe Council could maintain the existing conditions or adopt different hours and types of restrictions than recommended. The Council could also direct staff to pursue a Coastal Development permit prior to implementation of the regulation. Environmental AnalysisThe proposed project has been determined to be categorically exempt from the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), pursuant to Article 19, Section 15301 (c) which defines Class 1 exempt projects in the following way: Class 1 consists of the operation, repair, maintenance, permitting, leasing, licensing, or minor alteration of existing public or private structures, facilities, mechanical equipment, or topographical features, involving negligible or no expansion of use beyond that existing at the time of the lead agencys determination. The exemption includes: Existing highways and streets, sidewalks, gutters, bicycle and pedestrian trails, and similar facilities. Preferential parking zones involve only the issuance of permits for the use of an existing public street and include negligible or no expansion of the existing use. Next StepsIf preferential parking regulations are approved and there is no action pursued with the California Coastal Commission, regulations would be implemented on the 2300, 2400, and 2500 block of Fourth Street, and 500 block of Strand Street within eight weeks. This allows time for: residents to apply for permits, staff to process applications, signs to be ordered, manufactured, and installed, and a grace period between the installation of signs and the enforcement of preferential parking regulations. Additional blocks within the zone would have preferential parking implemented approximately eight weeks after receipt of a petition signed by residents representing two-thirds of the residential units of that block.#0 ", "background": "Preferential parking is a tool the City uses to manage non-resident parking use on residential streets, as authorized by Santa Monica Municipal Code Chapter 3.08 and the California Vehicle Code. Preferential parking regulations manage the use of on-street parking to make parking more available for residents near their home. Only residents who live on a block with preferential parking restrictions are eligible to purchase a permit. Permits may be used within two block faces of the permit holders address. Residents may petition to initiate a preferential parking zone at any time. Upon receipt of a petition representing two-thirds of the residential units on a block, a parking occupancy study of the neighborhood is conducted and a community meeting is held. In evaluating the petitions, staff typically evaluates the larger neighborhood, rather than an individual block due to the potential for parking displacement when regulations are established or changed. As a result, staff typically recommends that the Council pre-approve preferential parking regulations for more than one block to streamline and expedite the process for adjacent blocks should some displacement occur. SMMC 3.08.030 provides Council with the authority to create preferential parking zones. Once Council approves preferential parking regulations, they are implemented on the block or blocks that have submitted qualifying petitions. Preferential parking regulations are not implemented on blocks that have been pre-approved by the Council until the time that the residents of those blocks submit qualifying petitions representing two-thirds of the residential units on the block. ", "summary": "Residents of the 2300, 2400, and 2500 block of Fourth Street, and the 500 block of Strand Street have submitted qualifying petitions for preferential parking regulations. The residents assert that non-resident parking is impacting their ability to find parking near their homes. A parking study conducted in August and September of 2015 confirmed that street parking has high usage throughout the day for both the weekend and weekday. Staff recommends creating Preferential Parking Zone RR, approving the following preferential parking regulations for the following blocks:         Fourth Street between Pico Boulevard and Ocean Park Boulevard, and Strand Street, Pacific Street, and Bay Street between Third Street and Fourth Street with the regulation No parking 10 P.M. to 7 A.M., 2 hour parking 7 A.M. to 10 P.M., daily, except by permit, and          Strand Street between Fourth Street and Sixth Street with the regulation 2 hour parking 7 A.M. to 6 P.M. daily, except by permit (reclassifying these two blocks from Zone U to Zone RR). Should Council approve the recommended action it is estimated that permit sales for the 2300,2400, and 2500 blocks of Fourth Street would generate approximately $11,000 annually, which would offset, but not fully recover, the cost to the City of issuing permits to residents. New permit revenue would not be expected to be generated for the 500 block of Strand Street, as it has pre-existing preferential regulations that are being changed, so there would be few if any new permits issued. Additionally, new signage would be required at an estimated cost of $1,200 for all four blocks.

It is updated at least every five years as part of the State required Urban Water Management Plan. There are five stages (Advisory and Stage 1 to 4) of water supply shortages within the WSRP and actions range from voluntary to mandatory water conservation. The mandatory conservation requirements are implemented through Allowances assigned to water customers. Water customers are required to reduce their usage by a set percentage depending on the current stage of water supply shortage. Stage 1Stage 2Stage 3Stage 4% Water Available per Customer 85% 80% 70% 50%    In response to the unprecedented drought and its ongoing effects on Santa Monicas water supply, the City remains in a Stage 2 Water Supply Shortage that requires a 20% reduction in water use from 2013 levels. Local groundwater provides about 75% of the Citys water supply, which have yet to recover fully, even with the recent record-breaking rains. The natural process by which this occurs takes time and it may be a few years, along with more wet winters, for local groundwater supplies to return to pre-drought conditions.In order to be at least as effective as the current California Green Building Standards, the WSRP must be updated to reflect new requirements for plumbing fixture flow rates. This includes lower flows for urinals and faucets. As part of the recently adopted water neutrality ordinance, developers are required to calculate the projected water demand for the project. For the purpose of the water neutrality ordinance, new developments are defined as: new buildings with plumbing fixtures; existing buildings with plumbing fixtures where 50% or more of the exterior walls or major support structures are demolished; and/or new or enlarged pools, spas, water features, and ponds. If the calculated water demand from the proposed new development is greater than the amount the property currently uses (using a five-year average), then the developer must attempt to design a more water-efficient property through fixtures and systems (e.g. graywater and rain water harvesting). If the new development is still projected to use more water after all practical water-saving devices and systems are included in the design, then an in-lieu fee is required. Those fees pay to retrofit existing off-site buildings with water-saving fixtures to offset the additional water demand of the new development. Once approved, the calculated water demand for the new development would be used as the Allowance for the property during a declared water supply shortage providing a realistic yet water-conserving target. Currently, Allowances are a 20% reduction from usage in 2013. New developments that calculate greater water use than the current propertys five-year average would not likely meet Allowances as defined and, subsequently, could be fined for exceedances. This would trigger requests for adjustments to their Allowances. These adjustment requests would be granted because the developments would be built to the current water-efficient building requirements, which is a pre-requisite for an adjustment.  Setting the new developments Allowance as the calculated and approved water demand provides the most accurate water budget and would lead to fewer exceedance citations issued and fewer adjustment requests. Requiring the Allowance to equal the approved new water demand will encourage designer(s) of new developments to produce accurate estimations to help their clients avoid Allowance exceedance penalties. The Allowance would be updated after the certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy is issued. This proposed update to the Allowance would not apply to new or enlarged pools, spas, water features, and ponds.  OutreachFive Water Neutrality Stakeholder Committee meetings were held on November 15, 2016, December 12, 2016, January 24, 2016, March 8, 2017, and April 4, 2017, where proposed requirements of the ordinance and its implementation were discussed and a consensus on recommendations was achieved.

The WSRP was developed in 2009 to comply with the States Urban Water Management Plan requirements and was based on the California Department of Water Resources 2007 Urban Drought Guidebook.  On June 9, 2009, Council adopted the WSRP (Attachment D). The WSRP was included in the Citys 2010 Urban Water Management Plan, which was subsequently approved by the State. The WSRP mandates that when Stage 1, 2, 3, or 4 water supply shortage is declared, Allowances go into effect. This mandatory conservation requires water customers to reduce use by a set percentage from a prior years water usage. The City is currently in a Stage 2 water supply shortage and Allowances are in effect that are 20% below the customers 2013 water usage. Water customers that exceed their Allowance are subject to fines and civil penalties. Adjustments to the Allowance may be granted if certain criteria including water-saving plumbing fixtures are installed. Also on June 9, 2009, Council declared a Water Shortage Advisory calling for a voluntary 10% reduction in water use in response to the drought. The Water Shortage Advisory remained in place as part of the effort to reduce the need to import water from MWD and reach the Citys goal for water self-sufficiency by 2020. In response to the continuing drought, on January 29, 2014, the City increased its voluntary conservation target from 10% to 20% (Attachment E).  On August 12, 2014, Council adopted a resolution, per Attachment F, declaring a Stage 2 Water Supply Shortage, which changed the voluntary 20% conservation target to a mandatory 20% reduction in water use. It also directed staff to return with a detailed Stage 2 Water Supply Shortage implementation plan including proposed amendments to Section 7.16 of the Municipal Code and the WSRP, a financial impact analysis to address revenue reductions, additional staffing and program implementation costs, and an implementation timeline. On October 28, 2014, staff returned to Council and presented proposed updates to the WSRP (Attachment G) as well as information about proposed changes to the Municipal Code and implementation of water shortage response measures. Council provided feedback and directed staff to return with proposed changes to the WSRP that included input from the public, a Water Conservation Unit within the Office of Sustainability and the Environment to implement the Stage 2 Water Supply Shortage, and return with proposed changes to the Municipal Code that related to water conservation.  On January 13, 2015, Council re-affirmed and re-declared a Stage 2 Water Supply Shortage and adopted updates to the WSRP (Attachment H). This included Allowances for all water customers set at 80% of their 2013 water usage for Stage 2; established penalties for exceedance of Allowances; established residential water conservation thresholds for single family and multi-family residential customers; and provided a process for adjustment of an Allowance.  On September 8, 2015, Council adopted an update to the WSRP (Attachment I). The major updates were to modify the penalty fee structure for exceeding the Allowance and to provide for waiving of the first exceedance penalty by participating in a City-offered water school. On January 1, 2017, the current California Green Building Standards went into effect in Santa Monica lowering the flow rates for plumbing fixtures including urinals and faucets. The WSRP includes specific flow rates for plumbing fixtures that must be installed in order to receive a water use allowance adjustment. On May 9, 2017, Council adopted the water neutrality ordinance (Attachment J) that requires new developments to use no more water than the current usage.

The Citys fiber extends to One Wilshire telecommunications colocation facility in Downtown Los Angeles. This facility is an important telecommunications hub for the region, which the City leverages as a part of a broader strategy for its Information Technology (IT) business continuity and disaster recovery plan. The City uses its presence at One Wilshire as a conduit to its colocation data center facility in Las Vegas for disaster recovery; for access to Internet service providers (ISPs); to connect to the ICI (interagency communications interoperability) regional network for public safety radio communications; to provide access to broadband for Community Broadband customers; and, as a way to connect to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) for Internet telephony service.  The RFP issued in February 2017 requested that interested Internet telephony service providers present options to provide Internet telephony services at the following three facilities: 1) from the One Wilshire facility in Los Angeles, 2) at the Citys disaster recovery data center in Las Vegas, NV, and 3) at the Citys main data center in Santa Monica. These requirements are essential, as the current services for Internet telephony are available through all three facilities, which provides the City geographical diversity essential for its business continuity plan. During the RFP process, the City received and responded to questions from potential vendors who enquired about the requirement to offer Internet telephony service out of the Las Vegas data center facility.

Todays climate of heightened probability of terrorist activity of both domestic and foreign origin, coupled with Santa Monicas international appeal as a destination city and our numerous large-scale events, highlights the necessity of acquiring these additional mitigation resources which would help meet the Police Departments mission to safeguard the community. The canine project would be primarily funded by the UASI grant with the exception of the construction of the kennel at the officers place of residence and the officers uniform (the uniform for a canine officer is different from the standard patrol uniform). These are not allowable expenses under the UASI grant. The cost of those two items is estimated at $7,500 and will be absorbed by the Police Departments existing operating budget. The bomb detection canine would be a highly trained detection dog assigned to a law enforcement handler. Current officers will have the opportunity to apply, through a standardized selection process, for the canine handler position.

Access will reimburse Big Blue Bus monthly for total recorded Access customer boardings at the prevailing Senior/Disabled/Medicare local and express fares. Boardings are recorded through the onboard TAP mobile validators each time Access Services customers tap their TAP-enabled Access Services card.The premise of the Free Fare Program is to maximize limited resources to provide mobility services to a greater number of people that qualify for Access Services than what the traditional paratransit small passenger count van or other small vehicle service is able to accommodate. Access Services provides door-to-door service for persons with disabilities, however not all enrollees require door-to-door service. Many are able to use fixed-route systems with ease and are better able to meet their mobility needs riding transit, especially during peak times when their local Access Services provider is booked. Meeting the demands of Access Services customers through fixed-route systems is cost-efficient to Access Services as well as customer-friendly with more customers able to make their desired trips during peak-demand times. A single trip on Access Services is significantly more expensive than fixed-route transit primarily because it lacks the economies of scale fixed-route systems provide. A trip on fixed-route transit is much less labor intensive as a single motor coach can carry hundreds of passengers in an hour. It costs Access Services $33.02 per passenger trip while the operating cost per passenger trip on Big Blue Bus is $4.77. Each time an Access Services customer chooses to ride Big Blue Bus instead of Access Services, the region saves $28.25. The proposed agreement allows for fare adjustments should Big Blue Bus change its fare structure during the term of the agreement, whereby the new rates will apply without the need to renegotiate the agreement. The proposed agreement is open-ended, but will allow either party 90 days to terminate the agreement.The Free Fare Program has grown to 22 participating transit systems across Los Angeles County. Costs to pay for the program have grown exponentially and Access has capped the operators at their FY 2014-15 reimbursement levels as a way to control their costs.

Study Sessions", "body": {"other": "Economic UpdateThe U.S. economy continues to grow, but at a mild pace. Economic growth as measured by GDP was positive in 2016 for the seventh consecutive year, one of the longest economic recoveries on record but also one of the weakest.  Economic growth has averaged just 2.1% annually during the post-recession period and most economists are projecting continued modest growth (2-2.5% range annually) over the 2017-2019 time period.  Unemployment is at its lowest level in ten years.  The housing market remains strong and inflation continues to be low.  The Federal Reserve has begun to increase interest rates and is expected to continue these increases over the next two years in an effort to normalize rates. However, the economy is not without risks.  The policy impacts of the new administration in Washington cannot yet be determined.  Also, history would indicate that the economy is likely to head into a recession sometime within the next five years. The State economy recovered strongly from the Great Recession.  Growth in household incomes is exceeding the national average.  However, during that time, the State budget has also expanded in an attempt to correct long term issues.  However, after several years of strong growth, State revenues are beginning to fall short of projections.  According to the Governors FY 2017-18 Proposed Budget, an operating deficit of nearly $2 billion will occur next fiscal year with on-going deficits in the same range in the future unless corrective action is taken.  While the budget does propose corrective actions, the possibility of a recession in the next few years poses additional significant risks to the State Budget. Santa Monicas economy remains relatively strong due in large part to its geographic location and its diversified tax revenue base.  However, there are signs of moderation in the local economys growth rate.  General Fund revenue growth has begun to slow after several years of strong increases.  Average annual growth the last three years has been 3.2% following growth rates of over 8% in the three years of recovery following the recession. Also, as with the State and national economies, the threat of a recession could significantly alter revenue projections.  More information on some of the Citys key revenue sources is provided below. Property values in the City remain the third highest in Los Angeles County for a City with the 19th largest population.  The FY 2016-17 assessed value increase was 6.5% after a 6% gain the previous year.  Moderate increases of 3-4% are projected over the next five years. Sales tax growth rates are expected to be modest, reflecting the loss of several large tax generators and the shifting of retail activity to on-line sales. City taxable sales are projected to grow by 3% in FY 2017-18 and another 3.6% in FY 2018-19.  The additional half percent TUT tax approved by voters in November 2016, Measure GSH, will not remain in the General Fund as it will pass through to affordable housing uses and the School District. Tourism, which provides a major stimulus to the local economy by creating jobs and producing revenues, continues to show strength.  Transient Occupancy Taxes have increased at an average annual rate of 9.3% over the last six years, and revenues are expected to continue having healthy increases over the forecast period, reflecting the recent opening of two new hotels and another one that is under construction and anticipated to open within the next three years. One area of uncertainty over the forecast period is the impact of new registration requirements for home share hosting platforms. Business License Taxes are expected to show some weakness in FY 2017‑18, reflecting the loss of several of the largest taxpayers due to relocations, before resuming a moderate growth rate of just under 3% for the remainder of the forecast period.  Utility Users Tax revenues are declining slightly in FY 2017-18 and then staying flat over the forecast period as revenues from telecommunication services continue to drop.  Parking Facility Taxes are expected to grow by approximately 2% per year over the forecast period.  And interest rates, which fell to historically low levels over the last seven years, significantly impacting the Citys investment income, have begun to increase.  While a gradual increase is expected over the forecast period, rates are still expected to remain at relatively low levels. General Fund Financial Status UpdateThe May General Fund Financial Status Update reflects revised revenue projections as well as proposed operating and capital budget recommendations included in the Proposed Budget.  Assumptions related to retirement contributions and healthcare costs remain unchanged since the January forecast. Staff has completed three forecast scenarios that contemplate Best, Probable, and Worst Case impacts on the General Fund.  The chart below shows the three forecast scenarios. The Probable scenario, which serves as the baseline for the forecast, shows the General Fund experiencing a potential shortfall of approximately $3.8 million in FY 2019-20 that increases to almost $19 million (3.7% of the General Fund budget) in FY 2021-22. The major challenges to the Citys budget continue to be pension, health insurance and workers compensation costs.  The incremental lowering of the rate used by the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) to forecast the growth of its investments from 7.5% to 7.0% over three years beginning in FY 2018-19 will result in up to 23% increases in pension contribution rates within five years. This translates to an increase of approximately $2.0 million to General Fund retirement costs in FY 2018-19 that increase to almost $13 million in FY 2021-22, 70% of the deficit amount. Also negatively impacting the fund balance are the continued 8% annual increases in health insurance premiums and 10% annual increases in workers compensation costs that far exceed the 2.7% average annual growth rate of revenues. In the Best Case scenario, bolstered by higher increases in revenues, the General Fund would experience a potential shortfall of approximately $1.2 million in FY 2020-21 that increases to $8.3 million in FY 2021-22.  In the Worst Case scenario, which shows the effects of a possible recession, the General Fund would experience a shortfall of $4.3 million in FY 2017-18 that would increase significantly to $27.5 million in FY 2021‑22. Other Fund StatusOther major funds that are included in the Financial Status Update fall into two categories: 1) funds that operate with sufficient revenues to sustain necessary operating capital needs, and 2) funds that have a structural deficit where ongoing revenues are not sufficient to cover ongoing expenditures. Self-Sustaining Enterprise FundsThe Water and Wastewater Funds have sufficient revenues to cover current operations.  Rate increases in the Water Fund allow the implementation of the Sustainable Water Master Plan while also maintaining reserve levels.  The Wastewater Fund continues to have adequate revenues and reserves to meet current operational and capital expenditures. The Resource Recovery and Recycling (RRR) Fund will maintain a positive fund balance until FY 2019-20.  There are several upcoming proposals that may potentially have a substantial impact on the financial stability of the fund after FY 2019-20, including the piloting of a residential wet/dry collection system, expanding the commercial rot or not program, the Funds share of costs to complete the Corporate Yards modernization project, and the displacement of the recycling contractor at the Corporate Yards that will result in additional costs for transporting the City-collected recycling materials to an offsite location.  Staff will continue to monitor fund performance and consider the need for a rate increase in the future. The BBB Fund will also maintain a positive fund balance over the next five years.  BBB, like most transit agencies in the country, continues to be confronted with reduced ridership, and BBB staff continues to develop strategies to improve ridership.  The fund will receive additional revenue from the new voter-approved Measure M, which allocates an additional  cent sales tax to agencies in order to improve traffic congestion, keep transit fares affordable and improve bus systems. The Airport, Beach and Cemetery Funds will generate adequate revenues to sustain their operations throughout the next five years.  Funds Requiring General Fund SubsidiesThe Housing Authority Fund has a projected operating structural deficit of approximately $0.5 million to $1 million annually throughout the forecast period.  This assumes that U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funding to housing authorities will not be reduced. The Pier Fund is not able to sustain an adequate balance to cover both its operating costs and large capital expenditures.  Capital needs that are unable to be funded by the Pier Fund during the forecast period must compete with General Fund-supported capital needs.  FY 2017-19 Proposed Biennial BudgetThe Proposed Biennial Budget for the City of Santa Monica is balanced and totals $773.7 million in FY 2017-18 and $802.1 million in FY 2018-19.  The FY 2017-18 Proposed Budget is $118 million, or 18%, higher than the FY 2016-17 Revised Budget due to increased capital spending. The largest component of the budget is the General Fund, where most municipal services are funded.  The proposed General Fund budget is $504.9 million in FY 2017‑18 and $530.5 million in FY 2018-19.  FY 2017-18 General Fund expenditures increase $121.1 million or 32% over the FY 2016-17 Revised Budget due to the inclusion of capital improvement projects funded using reserves and bond proceeds.  FY 2018-19 expenditures increase $25.6 million, or 5%, over the FY 2017-18 Proposed Budget. As fiscal challenges continue, it is imperative for the City to be purposeful, watchful, and strategic about how funds are spent.  The FY 2017-19 Proposed Biennial Budget incorporates a new Framework that provides the structure for an overarching program to state core values, establish objectives, and measure progress made on those objectives.  The Framework, which captures work on strategic goals as well as departmental and citywide programs, policies and projects, is built on the Citys long-term commitment to sustainability and its new Wellbeing Index.  It begins the Citys shift towards a unified performance management system called SaMoStat.  The Framework is a living tool that will evolve as staff, with community input, targets services, policy initiatives and projects that will help move the dial on key outcomes and then develops metrics to monitor progress in meeting these outcomes. In the future, staff will collect and analyze relevant data and will use this Framework to make resource and programmatic decisions, and to address operational challenges, including how to most effectively meet needs for services using increasingly limited resources. In addition to the new Framework, the City has taken steps to control costs in the FY 2017-19 Proposed Budget and beyond by reallocating over $4 million in General Fund budget to areas requiring additional focus, rather than adding resources.  Among the new or augmented items staff is proposing to fund in the General Fund operating budget are:         Ongoing funding to ensure Tongva and Palisades Parks remain safe and welcoming for all users by employing on-site DTSM Ambassadors to greet patrons, monitor the Tongva Park public restrooms, and report maintenance problems to City maintenance staff and illegal activity to public safety officers, along with maintenance funding for the new Ishihara Park.           Two new attorney positions, supported in part by increased revenue recovery, in the Criminal and Code Enforcement areas to accommodate a large increase in workload for the City Attorneys Office due primarily to changes in state law that converted certain felonies to misdemeanor crimes, an uptick of activity relating to EXPO, and additional code enforcement caseload related to tenant protection, short term rentals, and more administrative citations.          In our internal services departments, additional funds for technology training, in addition to four new positions addressing high cost/high risk areas, based on recent independent assessments.  Besides cyber and data security, these include benefits billing audits and reconciliation, as well as procurement solicitations and negotiations.  We anticipate that these positions will generate offsetting savings and/or limit losses.          Staffing adjustments to increase permit processing and customer service, integrating review of tenant impacts of construction projects.  With training and support by the City Attorneys Office, Code Enforcement staff is also assuming additional responsibilities for tenant harassment enforcement to augment and expand existing enforcement efforts by the City Attorneys Office.          Childcare subsidies, provided through Connections for Children, for an additional 10 participants.  Subsidies benefit low and moderate income Santa Monica families with children up to kindergarten age.          To increase the diversity of our Fire personnel, and provide career opportunities and valuable training for local youth interesting in pursuing a career in the fire service, staff is implementing a Fire Cadet program.  Staff is also creating a Management Fellowship Program as a cost-effective approach to recruiting new talent. In other funds, staff proposes funding to implement the Water Neutrality Ordinance, as well as the extension of limited term water conservation staff while the City continues to work towards water self-sufficiency by 2020. Capital Improvement Program (CIP) BudgetOn June 14, 2016 (Attachment C), Council adopted the first year and approved the second year of the FY 2016-18 Biennial Capital Improvement Program Budget. The changes outlined in the CIP Addendum portion of the Proposed Budget are revisions to the second year of the approved Biennial Budget, FY 2017-18.  These changes are limited to needs that have risen during the first year of the Biennial Budget and cannot be deferred until the next biennial budget process.The revised FY 2017-18 CIP Budget totals $238.8 million.  This represents an increase of $117.2 million from the originally proposed FY 2017-18 CIP Budget and an increase of $125.1 million over the FY 2016-17 Adopted Budget of $113.7 million.  The total CIP Budget, including the General Fund portion, is higher than typical due to use of one-time reserves, bond financing, and settlement funds for specific projects noted below.  Budget changes are outlined in detail in the CIP Addendum section of the FY 2017-19 Proposed Biennial Budget (Attachment A). General Fund CIP Budget ChangesOf the total FY 2017-18 CIP budget, the General Fund portion represents $145.7 million or 61%.  The Proposed CIP Budget includes approximately $76.6 million in General Fund budget increases for the FY 2017-18 Exception Based CIP Budget that are funded using bond proceeds, project deferrals and released budget from cancelled projects.  The revised FY 2017-18 CIP budget is significantly higher than the originally proposed CIP budget due to updated plans regarding the financing of the City Services Building.  The FY 2016-18 CIP Adopted Biennial Budget assumed that lease revenue bonds would be issued to finance this project in FY 2018-19. This assumption was revised and the FY 2017-18 CIP Budget now includes $76.8 million in bond proceeds.  In addition, there are $3.6 million in other recommended General Fund budget increases that are completely offset by a total of $3.8 million in budget reductions, resulting in a net decrease of $0.2 million.  New or augmented General Fund projects cover $0.5 million in public safety projects, including Mobile Data Computer Replacement and Fire Particulate Exhaust Removal System; $2.2 million in Mobility/Parking projects, including Streetlight Installation, Structural Repairs to Parking Structures 1 and 3, and Bollards in Parking Structure 5; and $0.6 million in priority General Government projects, including Fire Department Tenant Improvements. In addition, $0.4 million is allocated to Percent for Arts for the new Fire Station 1. Projects deferred from the FY 2017-18 Budget Plan include Streetscape Planning and construction of the 17th Street/SMC/Expo Bike Path Connection project.  The deferred projects will be budgeted in the FY 2018-20 CIP Biennial Budget. Lastly, $0.75 million in Broadband for Affordable Housing Buildings previously budgeted in the General Fund is now funded by Community Development Block Grant funding. Non-General Fund Budget ChangesThe total net increase proposed for Non-General Fund budgets is approximately $40.9 million. A significant portion of the Non-General Fund budget increase is due to budget appropriations for affordable housing that total $19.5 million. These funds are comprised of redevelopment-related loan repayments and settlement payments that are being set-aside for affordable housing development. The FY 2017-18 budget also includes an increase of $14.5 million to maintain or improve water, wastewater, and stormwater runoff infrastructure, including the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Project (SWIP), Water Main Replacement project, the Clean Beaches Project, and drainage improvements.  The remaining significant Non-General Fund increases are from an appropriation of $2.9 million in Transportation Impact Fee Revenues for Lincoln Blvd. Streetscape Improvements and $1.8 million in the Airport Fund toward the airport runway reduction project.  Pier Fund projects were adjusted to accommodate the most updated priorities for Pier infrastructure maintenance, and budget increases in the Internal Service funds will accommodate increasing technology needs and new vehicle management technology. All but one of the proposed budget increases can be fully supported by an existing enterprise fund balance or special revenue source; the Pier Fund will require a General Fund subsidy of $1.4 million to fund capital needs in FY 2017-18. That amount is deducted from the annual General Fund CIP allocation, and as such, Pier Fund projects are considered in conjunction with General Fund projects during the budget process. Citywide Fee StudySince 1988, Council has directed staff to periodically conduct studies to calculate the Citys cost of providing various services that benefit individual users of the service rather than members of the community, and to determine if the City is recovering an appropriate share of these costs through user fees. It is City policy to achieve full cost recovery for these services, with some exceptions.  The Community & Cultural Services Department (CCS) fees, which average 32% cost recovery, are based on a pricing policy that reflects Council priorities for community recreation and social services benefits. At this time, staff is proposing no changes to CCS fees (with the exception of the Beach House) because following the adoption of the FY 2017-19 budget, staff will conduct a thorough analysis of CREST and Community Recreation program fees in order to develop proposed fee adjustments with an appropriate strategy for community stakeholder engagement.  Animal Control fees are also less than cost covering as cities traditionally subsidize these services to encourage licensing spaying/neutering. Some other fees are recommended for less than full cost recovery due to previous Council direction or statutory limits. A recent study prepared by MGT of America analyzed the cost of services in the Planning and Community Development, Public Works, Police, Fire, Community and Cultural Services, the Records and Election Services Departments as well as the Library. Zoning ordinance fees were not included in the study as they were recently reviewed and updated in coordination with the Zoning Code update in 2015.  Based on the study, which included the analysis of approximately 635 fees, staff recommends creating 40 new user fees and 2 new fines/penalty charges. Twenty nine of the new items are in the General Fund, increasing most fees to an appropriate level of cost recovery, reducing 89 fees, and eliminating 43 fees.  Staff anticipates implementation of the fee study recommendations will result in approximately $1.4 million in additional annual revenue, $1 million of which is in the General Fund. Attachment D (Fee Study Report) provides a summary of the results of the fee study, as well as the consultants report. Staff will return to Council with any necessary implementing ordinances and resolutions at the time of Budget Adoption. Beach Parking Rate IncreaseParking revenues account for 75% of Beach Fund revenue.  Beach Parking rates were last increased in November 2012.  Staff is recommending a moderate increase in beach parking rates to continue to provide the high quality of maintenance and services to the more than 17 million visitors to Santa Monica Beach each year, and to fully fund the long awaited capital improvements to the Beach Trail. The increase also recognizes the higher fees charged at adjacent County beaches in Venice and the Pacific Palisades as shown in the chart below: LocationWinterSummer WeekdayWeekendWeekdayWeekendVenice $6 $9 $9 $18 Will Rogers$6 $9 $9 $15 Dockweiler$6 $8 $8 $13 Point Dume$6 $8 $8 $14 Zuma$6 $8 $8 $10 Marina del Rey$6 $8 $10 $15  The chart below shows the current and proposed rates for the beach lots:  Central BeachSouth BeachNorth Beach Current ProposedCurrent ProposedCurrent ProposedSummer Weekday$12 $14 $8 $10 $8 $10 Summer Weekend$12 $14 $10 $12 $10 $12 Winter Weekday$6 $7 $6 $7 $6 $7 Winter Weekend$8 $10 $8 $10 $8 $10 Short-Term$1 per hrNo change$1 per hrNo changeNANA No changes are recommended for the Pier parking lot or the Annenberg Community Beach House lot at this time. The rate increase maintains the pricing policy that keeps prices higher in lots closest to the Pier and lower in the lots to the north and south, as a way to spread demand to match parking supply.  Monthly and annual permit fees, as well as event rental rates, will be reviewed in a future comprehensive study of citywide parking rates that is expected to be initiated in the next year. The proposed rate increase is expected to generate an additional $1.7 million annually; $1 million for FY 2017-18 since the rate increase is not effective until November 2017. The rate increase will ensure that sufficient funds are available for construction of the North Beach Trail Improvements in 2018, cover ongoing operations, and build up the Beach Fund balance to support additional capital needs in the future. Next StepsCouncil will convene a public hearing on June 27, 2017 to consider, receive public comment, make revisions to, and adopt the first year and approve the second year of the Biennial Budget, as well as to adopt the second year of the Capital Improvement Program Biennial Budget. Members of the public may provide comments on the Proposed Budget by sending an email to councilmtgitems@smgov.net or by giving public testimony at the May 23 and May 24 study sessions and Budget Adoption hearing on June 27, 2017. ", "background": "On January 24, 2017 Council reviewed the Five-Year Financial Forecast for the period FY 2017-18 through FY 2021-22 (Attachment B).

In the probable scenario, General Fund expenditures would slightly exceed projected revenues as early as FY 2017-18 and the structural deficit would reach $16.4 million by FY 2021-22. ", "summary": "This report presents the City of Santa Monicas FY 2017-19 Proposed Biennial Budget and Capital Improvement Program Budget for FY 2017-18, as well as the May 2017 Financial Status Update (Update) for the General Fund for Fiscal Years 2017-18 through FY 2021-22.  The Update includes the numbers set forth in the Proposed Budget as well as new information received since the Five-Year Financial Forecast was presented to Council on January 24, 2017. The FY 2017-19 Proposed Biennial Budget (Attachment A) is balanced, with resources dedicated to maintaining the Citys core services and allocating new and repurposed funding to programs that reflect Council priorities. Given the certainty that pension costs will rise sharply beginning in FY 2018-19 and the uncertainty about our national economy in future years, this budget lives within our means and begins the long-term reduction of our staffing levels to maintain Santa Monicas fiscal health and sustainability. While there is a slight increase in permanent staff in the General Fund to address emerging issues such as cybersecurity, reductions in staff in non-general funds mean a decrease of 3.8 FTE positions overall.  This budget incorporates an evolving new Framework that will ultimately link the results the City seeks to accomplish with the funding needed to achieve those results and the approach the City will take to measure performance.  The Proposed Biennial Budget is $773.7 million in FY 2017-18 and $802.1 million in FY 2018-19.  The significant increase is due to the inclusion of capital improvement projects funded using reserves and bond proceeds. The May 2017 General Fund Financial Status Update includes the FY 2017-19 Proposed Biennial Budget numbers in its projection of the Citys future budget climate.  The Update shows two years of positive General Fund structural balances before an anticipated deficit of approximately $3.8 million in FY 2019-20 that increases to almost $19 million (3.7% of the General Fund budget) in FY 2021-22.  The projected deficits are due primarily to increases in pension costs. The financial status of other funds remains relatively stable.  However, the Housing Authority Fund is projected to require subsidies through the end of the forecast period.  The Pier Fund is also projected to require subsidies as the combination of operating and large capital expenditures are outpacing the growth of revenues during the forecast period. Also presented in this report are the results of a citywide Fee Study (Attachment D) conducted to calculate the Citys cost of providing various services that benefit individual users of the service rather than all members of the community, and to identify changes to the current fee structure to ensure that the City is recovering an appropriate share of these costs through user fees. "}, "title": " Financial Status Update, FY 2017-19 Proposed Biennial Budget, and FY 2017-18 Proposed CIP Budget", "Sponsors": "Director Susan Cline, Director Donna Peter", "recommendations": ["      Receive the FY 2017-18 through FY 2021-22 Financial Status Update;", "      Receive City Departments presentations on the FY 2017-19 Proposed Biennial Budget; ", "      Review and provide direction to staff on the FY 2017-19 Proposed Biennial Budget and FY 2017-18 Proposed Capital Improvement Program (CIP) Budget (Attachment A); and", "      Review and provide direction to staff on the recommendations of the Fee Study Report (Attachment D) and proposed Beach Parking rates.", ""], "Department": "Finance Department, Budget Division"}], [], [], [], [{"Category": "07.

Ms. Berndts coordination of clinical support services with staff and service providers, in conjunction with implementing the HOUSE pilot program, provides property owners with support for special-needs tenants. A significant portion of households in affordable housing programs have special needs, including seniors, formerly homeless persons, and persons living with disabilities. Meeting the demand for clinical services helps assure property owners that special needs tenants will have assistance in accessing s variety of needed services.  Ms. Berndts services include in-home assessments, connecting participants with the appropriate service agencies, follow-up with participants and apartment owners, and providing technical training and support for staff. Contracting for the service enables participants and the City to benefit from specialize expertise. Ms. Berndts approach is unique and provides clinical services in non-clinical settings, usually as home-visit assessments. The method has allowed Ms. Berndt to establish trust and long-term relationships with many severely disabled individuals, resulting in housing stability. Additionally, Ms. Berndts credentials facilitate communications with service agencies and have led to more effective service deployment. Clinical services are a pivotal component to the success of supportive housing programs and homeless initiatives in general, and crucial to stabilizing program participants at risk of losing their affordable housing. Psychosocial assessments and interventions completed by Ms. Berndt determine appropriate referrals to mental health, substance abuse, and medical treatment service providers and systems of care. Ms. Berndt contributes to the exceptional level of service that both federally subsidized program participants and federal evaluators have come to expect from Santa Monica.  The proposed third modification to Agreement #10284 provides additional funds of $69,000 and extends the term date by one-year through June 30, 2018, to serve those at risk of losing their affordable housing.

Sprinkler main and branch lines are corrosion-resistant type PVC pipes which are not able to withstand prolonged exposure to sunlight. The sunlight exposure effects on the sprinkler pipes are most prevalent on the west side of the pier. Much of the piping had lost its original coloring, leading to concerns that it could possibly be damaged and eventually result in failure which would prevent proper activation of the sprinkler system. Corroded and damaged sprinkler heads, pipe supports and discolored PVC piping need to be replace with materials having protective corrosion-resistant coatings.

Coordinating the logistics for this newly envisioned COAST Open Streets Festival with programming that reflects the themes of mobility, culture and sustainability requires a unique combination of skill, vision and experience to make the event become a reality. The planning of the 2017 COAST Open Streets Festival will have significant involvement from the Cultural Affairs Division, Mobility Division and Office of Sustainability and the Environment, along with marketing and outreach assistance from the Office of Communications. Close coordination and cooperation from all departments is once again anticipated. Community stakeholders and organizations will be integrated into the planning and execution of COAST with opportunities for local organizations and businesses to participate.  The production needs for an open streets event include pre-production elements, relevant community outreach, traffic control plans, small business outreach, route and overall logistics planning and curating multiple hubs of activity, as well as marketing.  Programming of hubs involves site selection, site layout, provision of basic amenities such as first aid, water, and bike repair, and the curation of activity and entertainment timing and placement.  The comprehensive production of a community gathering of this scope is beyond the capacity of City staff. City staff from nearly all City departments will be engaged in varying degrees in executing a successful event, yet production assistance is necessary from an agency with specific knowledge and experience in executing events of this type and magnitude. Staff solicited feedback before, during and after the 2016 Coast Open Streets event. One of the primary concerns raised by stakeholders following the event was the already busy schedule in early June due to school graduations, summer weather, and holiday travel. Staffs consultation with the business communityparticularly those along the Coast routeindicated a preference for fall, since the summer is already incredibly busy; staff is focusing on October as the month for the event. The 2017 Coast Open Streets Festival is a community event that brings together the energy of Santa Monicas vibrant organizations, service providers, non-profits and interest groups. Staff is committed to outreach, communication and collaboration with the community for the event. Staff will engage our community, business, non-profit and transit partners in the planning process and provide them with opportunities to participate in the programming and activations of the day while also offering various outreach meetings for businesses and residents.    Contractor/Consultant SelectionOn December 14, 2016, the City published a Request for Proposals (RFP) for production services for the City of Santa Monicas COAST Open Streets Festival. The RFP was posted on the Citys online bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provisions. A total of 281 vendors were notified and 37 vendors downloaded the RFP. Four proposals were received from Community Arts Resources, Dyson & Womack, The M&M Group, and Work the Room. Proposals were evaluated based on the criteria in SMMC 2.24.072, including price, previous experience, ability to deliver, and compliance with City specifications. Based CARS previous experience and ability to produce events of this nature, CARS was identified as the best bidder. CARS is not the lowest bidder. The firm is recommended due to its extensive experience in events of this type and breadth of knowledge of Santa Monica and its culture. CARS cost was fair, reasonable and competitive compared to the three other proposal received. CARS will oversee all matters relating to the production and implementation of Santa Monicas COAST Open Streets Festival, including relevant community outreach, small business outreach, route and zone planning and overall logistics. CARS will work with the Office of Communications to coordinate all publicity and marketing for the event along with provide statistical reporting of attendance, social media impacts, and press coverage.  The contract to be awarded to CARS is for an amount not to exceed $300,000 for one year, with four one-year renewal options at a 2% increase, for a total not to exceed amount of $1,562,000 over a five-year period with future year funding based on an assessment of all of Santa Monicas annual events and contingent on Council budget approval.

An estimated 50,000 participants enjoyed activity zones focusing on the arts, sustainability, and mobility with additional activities programmed along the approximately two-mile route. The opening up of streets to pedestrians and bicyclists enabled participants to experience Santa Monica in a new way, while also enjoying Expo Light Rail and investments that Santa Monica has made to serve pedestrians and cyclists. The event had multiple activity zones that were programmed with performers, music, workshops, and DJs.  Due to the events popularity, over the past six months an interdepartmental staff committee has been evaluating the feasibility of continuing Coast. When considering this possibility, the committee analyzed the Citys existing event calendar, as well as available staff and financial resources. Since the 2016 Coast Open Streets pilot incorporated many elements that had been a part of the annual Santa Monica Festival, and because combining the events would create efficiencies in the staff and community resources needed for both events, the interdepartmental staff committee recommended that the Festival merge together with Coast. Staff also believes COAST provides an opportunity to host an annual event more fully reflective of Council and community values, including mobility, learn and thrive, and sustainability.  COAST will integrate the successful and engaging elements of the Santa Monica Festival elements to create a single community-focused event that encourages people to participate locally in an active environment that is both fun and educational.  It was also recommended that Coast expand to include opportunities for community organizations to participate, a component that was not included in Coast 2016, but is a popular part of the Santa Monica Festival.  Past features of the Santa Monica Festival that have been and will continue to be incorporated into Coast include:          Themes of culture and the environment along with relevant programming;          Entertainment such as art experiences, workshops and performances;          City Departments and Divisions showcasing their work, initiatives and projects through hands-on experiences, activities and demonstrations such as:o       the Mobility Division, with a zone dedicated to all things mobility related, including a bike exhibit and skills course; o       the Community Recreation Division through provision of active class opportunities; o       Public Works featuring their various large vehicles;o       and Buy Local showcasing local business and their wares.         Community organization and City Boards and Commissions information opportunities  While COAST is being proposed here as an annual event, its frequency may be evaluated in the future based on an assessment of all of Santa Monicas annual events and funding. Currently staff has recommended that the COAST Open Streets event be held annually each fall based on feedback from stakeholders that June was already too busy.  The recommendation to combine the tradition of the Santa Monica Festival with the Coast Open Streets event was initially presented to City Council in an Information Item submitted on February 23, 2017.

Administrative Proceedings", "body": {"other": "Property DescriptionThe structure on the subject property is a large, two-story former Home Savings of America building with elements indicative of a blend of Modern and classically formal architecture. A permit for the building construction was issued on November 17, 1969. S. David Underwood A.I.A. is listed as architect. The subject property is situated on the southeast corner of Wilshire Boulevard and 26th Street. The property is surrounded by a gas station to the north, an alley and a one to two-story multi-unit residential building to the south, one-story commercial businesses to the east, and a three-story office building to the west.  The building design is reflective of the collaboration between Howard Ahmanson, businessman and owner of Home Savings, and Millard Sheets, artist and designer, creating buildings that heightened the publics trust of the financial institution and further allowed the public to embrace the artwork as a reflection of local community history and values.  Former Home Savings of America, 2600 Wilshire Boulevard The former Home Savings building, which is clad in travertine, has a stepped profile with a flat roof, recessed parapet, and a prominent decorative frieze of patterned gold-colored glazed ceramic tiles that wraps around the building. There are full-height window slits on the north and west plaza-facing elevations. The primary entrance is asymmetrically located on the west faade and consists of a pair of fully glazed metal doors, flanked by floor-to ceiling, fixed glass panels with metal frames. A second entrance on the primary faade consists of glazed metal storefront doors with a substantial travertine surround that projects from the elevation. A secondary entrance from the parking lot is located on the east side of the building. It consists of a pair of fully-glazed metal doors with sidelights, accessed by a flight of concrete steps. A fixed, metal-framed window is located on the Wilshire faade.  Pleasures Along the Beach, Millard Sheets Directly above the buildings storefront is its primary focal point, a mural of colored mosaic tiles depicting a beach scene, Pleasures Along the Beach, designed by Millard Sheets. On the rear south side of the building is a large wall of stained glass, illustrating coastal activities, designed and executed by Susan Hertel. A rear bronze sculpture, Child with Dolphins by John Edward Svenson is located above the entrance leading from the east parking area. At the center of the front plaza facing the street corner is the bronze sculpture Family Group at the Beach by Richard Ellis.    Family Group at the Beach, Richard Ellis  Child with Dolphins, John Edward Svenson   Stained Glass window, designed by Susan Hertel Over the years, there have been a number of alterations to the buildings exterior. In order to meet ADA requirements, new concrete steps and hand railings leading to the main entrance were installed along with a disabled access ramp east of the steps. A similar non-original ramp leads from the sidewalk along Wilshire Boulevard to the rear east entrance. Later, when new retail operators replaced the bank, a new second entrance on the primary faade consisting of glazed metal storefront doors with a substantial travertine surround was added and the buildings original interior was completely remodeled. The buildings symmetry was negatively affected by this substantial alteration. Historic Resources Inventory Status The subject property has not been previously identified as appearing eligible for listing or designation under any criteria in the Citys Historic Resources Inventory (HRI) or in any earlier surveys, nor is it located within the boundaries of a potential historic district or grouping.  Landmarks Commission ActionOn May 13, 2013, in accordance with authority granted under the Landmarks Ordinance, the Landmarks Commission proactively filed an application to consider designation of the former Home Savings building as a City Landmark. After holding a public hearing, the Landmarks Commission designated the building as a City Landmark on December 9, 2013 and the site as a Landmark Parcel. The property owner filed a timely appeal on December 13, 2013 contending that the Landmarks Commission wrongly designated the building as a City Landmark and the property as a Landmark Parcel. While the appeal was still pending before the City Council, a new court decision concluded that the proactive designation process used for this property might be legally problematic because it may not comport with due process requirements. Subsequent to this development in case law, the property owner submitted materials to supplement the previously-filed appeal. On November 1, 2016, City Council upheld the appeal, in part as to certain procedural matters, and remanded the pending Landmark designation application back to the Landmarks Commission. The City Councils decision did not result in a substantive disapproval of the application. Indeed, the City Council did not consider whether the property met the criteria for designation. The Landmarks Commission, consisting of a quorum of four Commissioners who were appointed after the initial designation hearing on December 9, 2013, held a Public Hearing on the Landmark Designation application on February 13, 2017. These four Commissioners had no involvement in the filing or review of the original Landmark designation providing the opportunity for an unquestionably neutral determination of the Landmark designation application. As part of the public hearing, the Landmarks Commission, consisting of the quorum of four Commissioners, considered the following materials that are part of the public record:  A City historic consultant report from Historic Resources Group (HRG) prepared in December 2016 that concludes that the property retains its architectural integrity and the integrated artwork, captures the spirit of Santa Monica and represents the talents of noted artists. The report recommended that the building in its entirety be designated a City Landmark as the only example of a former Home Savings bank building and related artwork in the City of Santa Monica that was designed or collaboratively designed by Millard Sheets;                      A Landmarks Commission staff report that concurs with HRG and recommends designation based on five of the six designation criteria;                      Written correspondence from members of the public, including former Landmarks Commissioners and other preservation specialists, offering opinions that strongly encouraged Landmark designation; and                      Written correspondence from the property owners legal representative, Roger Jon Diamond, that strongly opposed the designation of the building and property, and included an extensive and detailed collection of all prior staff reports, commission minutes, agendas and consultant reports as collected and presented by the, that details the prior history of the building and site when it was previously considered for Landmark Designation. Included with this material is a Landmark Assessment report prepared by the property owners historic consultant that concludes that the property is not eligible for designation.  Additional attachments were received from Mr. Diamond that are to voluminous to recopy but are available for public review in the Planning Division.  At the hearing, the Commission heard testimony from two members of the public that endorsed the designation of the building and parcel, noting the significance of its integrated artwork which represents the combined vision of businessman Howard Ahmanson and artist Millard Sheets. An audio excerpt of an interview with Millard Sheets was also introduced in the public record by the property owners representative in which Mr. Sheets described the mosaic at 2600 Wilshire Boulevard as satisfactory and also expressed his reservations about the overall size and level of integration of the mosaic on the primary elevation of the building. During deliberation, members of the Commission discussed the significance of the former Home Savings and Loan Bank building and its associated artwork within the context of Santa Monicas history; recognized the significance of Millard Sheets; identified the building as having a significant presence and a representation of Santa Monicas history. Some members expressed concern about the alterations that had occurred to the building, particularly the changes to the west elevation that had diminished the design symmetry, but ultimately concluded that the building retained sufficient physical integrity and was still able to visually convey its historic significance. Members also acknowledged the personal criticism of the mural expressed by its artist Millard Sheets, but further noted that the artwork is still distinctive and well-known throughout the greater Santa Monica community. One Commissioner expressed opposition to the buildings designation, noting that the building offers very little architectural merit, and that the only potential items of merit are some of the art pieces.  A motion to designate the property under five of the six criteria (#s 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6) was moved and seconded. Although three of the four members of the Commission present at the public hearing on February 13, 2017 voted to designate the building and parcel at 2600 Wilshire Boulevard as a City Landmark and Landmark Parcel based on four of the six designation criteria, a technical denial resulted because a motion to designate the subject building and parcel as a City Landmark and Landmark Parcel failed to receive four votes in the affirmative as required by the Landmarks Commissions Rules of Order for substantive matters. The final vote on the matter was three (3) ayes, one (1) nay, and three (3) recusals. The Landmarks Commissions draft Statement of Official Action is presented as Attachment B. It was not adopted due to a lack of a quorum at the March 13, 2017 meeting. The Commission will consider the Statement of Official Action on April 19, 2017. The February 13, 2017 Landmarks Commission meeting minutes and staff report are presented as Attachments C and D, respectively.   The appellant, the Santa Monica Conservancy, filed a timely appeal on February 21, 2017. In its statement, the appellant concludes that the designation of the subject building as a City Landmark was overwhelmingly supported by the evidence presented in the public record, including the Citys staff report and historic consultant report, local preservation experts, and by a majority of the Commission members present during the public hearing. The appellant believes that the one dissenting vote cast during the public hearing, which resulted in the technical denial, was arbitrary and subjective, and did not fully take into account the evidence that was presented in support of designation. Finally, the appellant contends that had Staff, in the written and oral staff reports, indicated to the four Commissioners present during the public hearing that a unanimous vote would be required for designation, a different outcome may have resulted. Appeal AnalysisThe Council, in its de novo review of this appeal, is being asked to determine whether the proposed project meets the findings required for Landmark designation identified in SMMC Section 9.56.100. The Council may uphold the appeal or uphold the decision of the Landmarks Commission, in whole or in part, based upon these findings. As noted above the appellant has identified three points for overturning the Landmarks Commissions decision. Each statement and staffs analysis is provided below. 1.     The designation of the subject building as a City Landmark is overwhelmingly supported by the evidence presented in the public record. The appellants conclusion concerning the preponderance of evidence in support of the designation of the former Home Savings building at 2600 Wilshire Boulevard included as part of the public record on the matter, is accurate. The Citys historic consultant, Historic Resources Group (HRG), was asked to consider the subject property relative to the Landmark Designation criteria and provide its independent analysis and recommendation in the form of a written report for Landmarks Commission consideration. This report, which was prepared specifically for the remanded hearing and independent of the prior analysis conducted by the City, is included as Attachment E.  This report concludes that the subject property meets five of the six Landmark Designation criteria as specified in the Citys Landmarks Ordinance, and provides detailed recommended findings to support its conclusion. Additionally, the Staff Report that was prepared for the Landmarks Commission concurs with HRGs recommendation for designation based on five of the six criteria.  Correspondence and testimony from the general public was also received in advance and during the public hearing, including written letters and emails from individuals who have backgrounds and interest in historic preservation. This correspondence supported the designation of the property as a City Landmark. The Commission was also in receipt of written correspondence from the property owners legal representative which recommended against designation. Although much of this correspondence generally challenged the procedural legalities of this particular designation application, and the manner and procedures in which it was processed, reviewed and acted upon, a Landmark assessment report, prepared by the property owners historic consultant, was included with this material that concluded that the property did not appear to meet any of the Citys Landmark Designation criteria. Staff believes that there was enough evidence in the record to support the Landmark designation and that such a designation could withstand given the evidence in the record. 2.     The dissenting vote, which resulted in the technical denial, was arbitrary and subjective, and did not fully take into account the evidence that was presented in support of designation. The Citys Landmark and Historic District Ordinance (Santa Monica Municipal Code Chapter 9.56) formally establishes a seven-member Landmarks Commission as a quasi-judicial, discretionary body, whose membership is appointed by the City Council. This Ordinance delegates certain power and authority to this Landmarks Commission to advance historic preservation goals throughout the City, including the power to designate a structure, improvement, natural feature or object as a Landmark based on qualifying criteria. SMMC Section 9.56.100 describes the Landmark designation criteria. When conducting a Landmarks designation hearing, the Landmarks Commission is asked to determine whether based on the evidence presented at the hearing, the property meets one or more of the criteria set forth in SMMC 9.56.100. In doing so, individual Commissioners exercise their independent judgment when applying the evidence to the criteria.   During the February 13, 2017 hearing on the matter of the Landmark Designation application for the former Home Savings building only four Commissioners were able to be seated for the public hearing. On a motion to designate the building and site as a Landmark and Landmark Parcel, one Commissioner, based on the evidence presented at the hearing, determined that the property did not meet any criteria in SMMC 9.56.100. This Commissioner was presented with all the same information as the rest of the Commissioners present at the hearing, clearly articulating their opinion that the former Home Savings building is monolithic in appearance and brutal in its approach, and lacked any architectural merit. This Commissioner further suggested that the only items of potential merit would be the art pieces, specifically the sculptures. This vote was not arbitrary and unsubstantiated. This Commissioner stated his opinion for the record that the building lacked architectural merit and could not make the required findings, but that there may be historic significance to certain features found on the property (i.e. some of the artwork) as described in all of the reports and testimony. However, since the motion offered was for the designation of the building and site in its entirety as a City Landmark and Landmark Parcel, this Commissioner did not support the motion as presented. 3.     If staff had indicated in written and oral staff reports to the Landmarks Commission that a unanimous vote would be required for Landmarks designation, a different outcome may have resulted. The Landmarks Commission has adopted Rules of Order to inform the Commission on its protocol and conduct while carrying out Commission business. These Rules provide specific guidance that require a vote of at least four members to carry out substantive matters, without exception (Rule 2). The approval of a Landmark Designation is a substantive matter. Although the circumstances and prior history of this specific designation application is complex and unusual, there isnt a noted exception to allow the designation of a Landmark to occur without a vote of four members in support regardless of the number of Commissioners present to hear a matter. Although in hindsight, staff accepts that this fact could have been reiterated in its Staff Report, staff believes the fact that it wasnt has no bearing on the expressed opinions of the individual Commissioners.  ConclusionFrom the onset, the model for the construction of Home Savings branches, as dictated by owner Howard Ahmanson, was to instill public trust and confidence in the banking institution and still reflect traditional family and community values. This was achieved through marrying art and architecture with building design. Each aspect was integral to creating a unique and cohesive design that was indicative of the Home Savings brand and model. In addition, the building, with its clean lines and lack of ornamentation, acts as a frame that allows the artwork to standout prominently, particularly the mural.  It has been stated that other extant examples in the region are architecturally superior (the original prototype branch located in Beverly Hills) and/or exhibit a higher level of historic integrity (the Anaheim branch, which is nearly identical) than the Santa Monica building. While these may better reflect the ideals and imagery that is representative of the former Home Savings of America, the City has no jurisdiction or ability to exert any protections over these outlying buildings. The City of Santa Monica has one extant former Home Savings and it is the City Councils charge to determine if this specific resource tells a distinct story reflective of Santa Monicas unique history based upon the criteria described in SMMC Section 9.56.100 of the Landmarks Ordinance.  In applying the Citys significance criteria for individual recognition as a proposed City of Santa Monica Landmark, the staff believes that the building meets the threshold for Landmark designation based on five of the Citys designation criteria. Therefore, staff recommends that the City Council grant the appeal and designate the former Home Savings building as a City Landmark and the subject property as a Landmark Parcel based upon the findings required by SMMC Section 9.56.100:  (1) It exemplifies, symbolizes, or manifests elements of the cultural, social, economic, political or architectural history of the City.  The property symbolizes a period of Santa Monicas postwar architectural history. Specifically, the property is an example of postwar bank architecture and is one of only two examples of a Home Savings and Loan branch office with a modified v-shaped, projecting-wing building plan designed by artist Millard Sheets in collaboration with architect S. David Underwood. The building was constructed in a period of rapid expansion and growth for the Home Savings and Loan Association. The monumental massing, formal symmetrical faade arrangements, high quality materials and integrated artwork, including one of the largest mosaic murals commissioned by Home Savings, is representative of the Home Savings building program that resulted in some of the most iconic and recognizable buildings in Southern California. Although there have been some minor alterations, the integrity of the structure remains high in terms of location, design, setting, workmanship, feeling, and association. Further, the character-defining features on the building exterior and site remain intact including:          Plaza paved in exposed-aggregate concrete         Circular, tiered planter with bronze sculpture         Wide, raised terrace with a battered masonry wall, integral raised planters, and wide concrete steps          Two-story volume and symmetrical composition         V-shaped plan         Complex massing consisting of a tall, high volume central pavilion with a hexagonal plan, flanked by lower two-story volume wings with rectangular plans          Flat roofs with low parapets         Exterior walls clad in travertine slabs         Continuous friezes of textured ceramic tile, bordered by travertine fillets         Clusters of fixed, metal-framed, vertical strip windows with wide travertine mullions          Large stained-glass window on the east faade         Floor-to-ceiling, fixed glass panels with metal frames at primary entrance         Mosaic tile mural directly above the primary entrance         Secondary entrance from the parking lot with a pair of fully-glazed metal doors with sidelights, and concrete steps with battered masonry cheek walls         Wall-mounted bronze sculpture  Although the Home Savings branches built during the postwar era had similar qualities to maintain design continuity, the Santa Monica location is distinguished by the orientation of the building to the street corner and the works of art that reference the local Santa Monica beach culture.  (2) It has aesthetic or artistic interest or value, or other noteworthy interest or value. The property includes examples of artwork which are unique to the Santa Monica location and are distinguished by their size and arrangement on the projecting-wing building plan. The most prominent work is the 40-foot wide mosaic mural on the primary faade depicting local themes including swimming, yachting, fishing, and beach games. The themes established in the mosaic influenced the remainder of the artwork on the property including a plaza fountain topped by a bronze sculpture of a family at play in the surf. Another bronze sculpture of a child with dolphin decorates the east-facing faade along with a stained-glass window that was intended to give a kaleidoscope of beach activity depicting swimming, beach games, and figures with animals located on the south elevation. The size of the mosaic mural represents a departure from the Millard Sheets traditional aesthetic of smaller vignettes across a field of darker material. As such, the property has aesthetic and artistic value because not only is the mural an unusual example of large-scale artwork within the Home Savings building program, but the projecting-wing building plan was also atypical and is a distinctive feature of the property. While other branch buildings were characterized by building wings that usually project from the secondary faade creating elongated rectangular plans, the Santa Monica branch incorporates the familiar Home Savings design elements integrated with a modified v-plan and plaza that makes the subject property noteworthy, and as such, it also possesses artistic and aesthetic value. (4) It embodies distinguishing architectural characteristics valuable to a study of a period, style, method of construction, or the use of indigenous materials or craftsmanship, or is a unique or rare example of an architectural design, detail or historical type valuable to such a study.  The Santa Monica Home Savings Building is an excellent local example of the postwar building program set forth by the Home Savings and Loan Association. During the 1950s to 1970s, Home Savings embarked on an ambitious building program that started with the completion of the 1956 branch office in Beverly Hills. Public reaction was so positive that instead of expansion through acquisition, Howard Ahmanson, founder of Home Savings and Loan Association, decided expansion would occur through construction of new branch offices in high-demand areas. The building designs came to represent Home Savings corporate identity with continuity in its readily-identifiable monumental form, cladding, fenestration, and location-specific artwork. The Santa Monica branch is unique in terms of its high volume central pavilion with projecting wings resulting in a distinctive, modified v-shaped plan. The Santa Monica Home Saving Building is one of only two known examples of this type (the other was constructed in Anaheim) and is therefore the only example of its kind in Los Angeles County. (5) It is a significant or a representative example of the work or product of a notable builder, designer or architect.  The building was designed by Millard Sheets, who was a prominent Southern California artist, in collaboration with architect S. David Underwood. Sheets use of integrated artwork in his commercial building designs attracted the attention of Howard Ahmanson who commissioned him to design a series of branch offices for Home Savings. The branch offices of the Home Savings and Loan Association represented the introduction of integrated artwork into the commercial aesthetic with links to local culture through references to location-specific themes and motifs. The monumental massing, formal symmetrical faade arrangements, high quality materials and integrated artwork came to define Home Savings corporate identity making the branch offices instantly recognizable. Over his nearly thirty-year involvement with Home Savings, Sheets designed over forty branch locations in California including new construction, renovations, and the installation of artwork in temporary locations.  (6) It has a unique location, a singular physical characteristic, or is an established and familiar visual feature of a neighborhood, community or the City. The Santa Monica branch of the Home Savings and Loan Association is readily-identifiable by its monumental form and aesthetic, and situated on the parcel with its primary volume and entrance oriented at a 45-degree angle to a prominent corner street (west primary faade). Compared to other Home Savings branch offices, the Santa Monica branch office is unusual and noteworthy for its orientation and building plan. Furthermore, with its distinctive and prominent artwork and associations with the corporate identity of the Home Savings and Loan Association, the building is an established and familiar visual feature at the southeast corner of Wilshire Boulevard and 26th Street. AlternativesAs a de novo matter before the City Council, the Council may consider other options which it deems appropriate, including denying Landmark designation, or designating specific components of the building and/or site individually or collectively, based upon the testimony and evidence presented in the full public record.  Environmental AnalysisThe project is exempt pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3). Section 15061(b)(3) provides that CEQA only applies to those projects that have the potential for causing a significant effect on the environment. Since the proposed action would result in the retention of the existing structure and would not change the existing environmental baseline, there is no potential that the project would cause a significant effect on the environment. Public OutreachThe public notice for this hearing concerning 2600 Wilshire Boulevard was published at least 10 days prior to the hearing in the Santa Monica Daily Press and mailed to all property owners and occupants within 300 feet of the subject property.  ", "summary": " The appellant, the Santa Monica Conservancy, has filed an appeal of the findings of the Landmarks Commission in its February 13, 2017 technical denial of the former Home Savings building as a City Landmark and site as a Landmark Parcel.  The former bank building and site have been analyzed by the Citys historic consultant who has concluded that the building - constructed in 1970 - retains the key character defining features typical of Home Savings branches. It exhibits physical integrity and represents the talents of noted artists with its mosaic mural, bronze sculptures and stained glass window which were designed as integral elements of the building and capture the spirit of Santa Monicas history.  A quorum of four Landmarks Commissioners participated in the February 13, 2017 public hearing on the Landmark Designation application. These four Commissioners had no involvement in the filing of the proactive Designation application in May 2013 or the original public hearing in December 2013 when the Commission designated the building and parcel as a Landmark. On February 13, 2017, three of the four members of the Commission present at the public hearing voted to designate the building and parcel at 2600 Wilshire Boulevard as a City Landmark and Landmark Parcel based on four of the six designation criteria. However, a technical denial resulted because a motion to designate the subject building and parcel as a City Landmark and Landmark Parcel failed to receive four votes in the affirmative as required by the Landmarks Commissions Rules of Order for substantive matters. This report highlights the points of the appeal, the Landmarks Commissions action, and staffs position relative to the designation based on required criteria for designation.

The substantive environmental impact analyses for the HASP amendment, Phase Two Project Master Plan, and substantive amendment to the Development Agreement will be conducted for the project through preparation of an Environmental Impact Report in compliance with California Environmental Quality Act requirements.  Conclusion & Next StepsStaff recommends Council execute a second amendment to the Saint Johns Health Center Development Agreement to address procedural requirements that will serve to ensure comprehensive review of the Phase Two Project. This amendment establishes a Master Plan for all North and South Campus development. It requires a Phase Two Project Phasing Plan to establish the timeframe for buildout of the uses and floor area authorized by the Development Agreement. The second amendment also requires the Master Plan include a comprehensive phasing plan. This phasing plan will identify specific milestones for completion of integral project components, including infrastructure, open space improvements, and required on-site parking. Amendments to the HASP will also be processed to ensure that the Master Plan and future substantive amendments to the Development Agreement are consistent with the HASP and the City's General Plan.  It is anticipated that the Phase Two Project Master Plan, Phasing Plan, and forthcoming substantive Development Agreement Amendments, that would be necessary to establish community benefits and a revised vesting deadline for the Phase Two Project, will be scheduled for public hearings at Planning Commission and City Council in 2018-2019. These hearings will occur after environmental review and project negotiations are completed for the Phase Two Project ", "background": "The original Development Agreement was executed in July 1998 with a 55-year term to guide phased reconstruction and future development of Saint Johns Health Center after the 1940s-built hospital sustained substantial damage from the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The Development Agreement authorized vested rights for two phases of development on Saint Johns-owned property.  Phase One development consisted primarily of rebuilding core hospital facilities and creating a new plaza on Santa Monica Boulevard. This phase was substantively completed in 2013. The Development Agreement established the parameters for Phase One rebuilding and required an annual community benefit plan for the 55-year term of the Agreement. A first amendment to the Development Agreement was approved by the City Council in 2011 principally to address how Phase One parking would be provided by the Health Center. Providence has proposed Phase Two development in accordance with the vested rights for up to 799,000 SF of floor area and permitted uses authorized by the Development Agreement. The Phase Two project is located on Applicant-owned parcels on both sides of Santa Monica Boulevard and proposes a health care campus to expand the services currently provided by the hospitals diagnostic and treatment center, in-patient suites, an emergency department, and a medical research facility (John Wayne Cancer Institute and Research Center).  North Campus development would occur on three sites: two building sites are located on the east and west sides of the existing Entry Plaza, and one building site is located mid-block along 20th Street between Santa Monica Boulevard and Arizona Avenue. South Campus development would occur on five sites where the current John Wayne Cancer Institute and two surface parking lots are located south of Santa Monica Boulevard.  In March 2015, Providence proposed an amendment to the previously-approved Development Agreement. The amendment pertained to Phase Two Development on the north and south campuses of the Health Center campus. In the originally-proposed amendment, Providence sought an extension of the expiration dates for each of the eight Development Review Permits submitted for Phase Two. The amendment was to allow development in five phases over an approximately twenty-three year period. Providence made this request because it is unable to construct the entire Phase Two Project within the timeframes currently provided by the Development Agreement. Providence also stated that this amendment is necessary because it must maintain current Health Center operations and provide required parking through the duration of Phase Two construction. The amendment would allow Providence to focus on elements identified as programmatic priorities and necessary components for orderly build out of the Phase Two Project in the near-term, while having assurance that longer-term future development at the Health Center can occur in response to changing community health care needs.  As part of the Citys preliminary review of Providences proposed Development Agreement amendment, several key issues were identified for further discussion during the Planning Commission and Council float-up/concept hearings. More specifically, staff's proposed procedural amendment to the Development Agreement was created as an alternative to Providences proposal. That proposal presented challenges to establishing comprehensive review of the Phase Two development as a whole, and substantive review of individual buildings closer to the time of construction. Providences amendment contemplated review of Development Review Permits for Phase Two buildings nearly 20 years in advance of construction.  Discussion Proposed Procedural AmendmentConsistent with the procedural requirements for Phase Two development set forth in the Development Agreement, a proposed Master Plan to guide the development of the Health Centers South Campus was submitted by Providence in February 2015. Development Review Permit applications for the eight originally-proposed Phase Two buildings located on both the North and South Campuses were filed in March 2015. All of these required applications were submitted and deemed complete prior to the July 9, 2015 Phase Two Vesting Deadline established by the Development Agreement.  The staff-proposed procedural amendment addresses the following: Phase Two Project Master PlanCurrently, the Development Agreement specifies that the Planning Commission takes action on a South Campus Master Plan  for South Campus development sites only  with Council review only on an appeal of the Commissions action. The staff-initiated procedural amendment would establish Councils authority to review and take action on a comprehensive Phase Two Project Master Plan. This framework is warranted not only because of the large scope of development contemplated, but also because of the traffic circulation changes and integration of the North and South Campuses contemplated by the Phase Two Project.  This change would comport with the quasi-legislative character of the master plan and would require that all Phase Two development, on both the north and south campuses, be consistent with the Phase Two Project Master Plan.  Comprehensive Phasing Plan During the float up discussion on December 6, 2016, Council authorized staff to initiate negotiations in response to Providences request for an extension of time to build out the Phase Two Project. Council directed the establishment of a Phase Two Project Master Plan and Phasing Plan to provide a framework for comprehensive and integrated review, and orderly build-out, of the project beyond the timeframes currently authorized by the Development Agreement. With this approach, the Applicant would not be required to obtain Development Review Permit approval of all proposed development within the timeframe currently necessitated by the existing vesting deadlines in the Development Agreement.  The comprehensive Phase Two Project Phasing Plan would be provided as a component of the forthcoming Phase Two Master Plan and provide a timeline and framework for phased review of each building and a schedule of performance for associated infrastructure, community benefits, and site features over the approximately 23-year buildout period.  In summary, the proposed procedural amendment would accomplish the following: 1.     Establish the City Council as the Citys decision-maker with respect to the Phase Two Project Master Plan, consistent with the City Councils role as the Citys legislative body and the quasi-legislative nature of the Phase Two Project Master Plan.2.     Expand the Master Plans scope to include all of Health Centers Phase Two Project, not only the South Campus portion of Phase Two, thus facilitating more comprehensive and integrated review of Providences Phase Two Project and development.3.     Require the Phase Two Project Master Plan to include a Phase Two Project Phasing Plan, allowing the City to structure a review process with (a) staggered deadlines for Saint Johns to file Development Review Permits for the Phase Two buildings so that the buildings will be reviewed closer in time to when they will be constructed and (b) a performance schedule for important components such as infrastructure, circulation improvements, and community benefits.4.     Eliminate Saint Johns ability to bring forward Development Review Permits for Phase Two buildings on the North Campus in advance of approval of a comprehensive Phase Two Project Master Plan.5.     Facilitate the orderly build out of Saint Johns Vested Uses and Vested Floor Area as provided in the Development Agreement (as amended) and the Phase Two Project Master Plan. Attachment B contains the procedural text amendments to sections of the Providence Saint Johns Health Center Development Agreement that are consistent with the five items outlined above.  Hospital Area Specific Plan The Hospital Area Specific Plan (HASP) was adopted on September 27, 1988, and amended in June 29, 1993 and April 1, 1998. The HASP area includes all of the Saint John's Health Center parcels as well as other medical-related properties bounded by 20th Street, 23rd Street, Broadway, and Arizona Avenue. Future amendments to the HASP will be necessary to ensure that the Master Plan and future substantive amendments to the Development Agreement are consistent with the HASP and the City's General Plan.  ", "summary": "This report recommends approval of a City staff initiated procedural amendment to the Providence Saint Johns Health Center Development Agreement to address a procedural change in the Phase Two Project approval process to require Council review and approval of a Phase Two Project Master Plan that encompasses development at the Providence Saint Johns Health Center located at 2121 Santa Monica Boulevard (PSJHC or Health Center). This City-initiated procedural amendment is consistent with Council direction during its float-up discussion on December 6, 2016 (Attachment A) regarding a second amendment proposed by Providence Health & Services (Providence).  In summary, the proposed procedural amendment would accomplish the following: 1.     Establish the City Council as the Citys decision-maker with respect to the Phase Two Project Master Plan. 2.     Expand the Master Plans scope to include all of the Health Centers Phase Two Project. 3.     Require the Phase Two Project Master Plan to include a Phase Two Project Phasing Plan, allowing the City to structure a review process that includes a performance schedule for important components such as infrastructure, circulation improvements, and community benefits. 4.     Eliminate Saint Johns ability to bring forward Development Review Permits for Phase Two buildings on the North Campus in advance of approval of a comprehensive Phase Two Project Master Plan. 5.     Facilitate the orderly build out of Saint Johns Vested Uses and Vested Floor Area as provided in the amended Development Agreement and the Phase Two Project Master Plan.  On December 6, 2016, the Council held a float-up discussion for Providences request to extend the timeframe to build out the Phase Two Project authorized by the original Development Agreement executed in 1998. Council discussed Providences amendment request and staffs alternative regulatory framework for the Phase Two Project. Council authorized staff to initiate negotiations in conjunction with Providences request for an extension of time to complete the Phase Two Project. The Council also provided community benefit recommendations and supported the staff-recommended framework to establish Council approval of a Phase Two Project Master Plan and a comprehensive Phase Two Project Phasing Plan. The City-recommended procedural amendment to the Development Agreement was presented to the Planning Commission for a formal recommendation on February 15, 2017. At this meeting, the Planning Commission voted 7-0 to recommend that the City Council approve the procedural amendment. The amendment would establish a comprehensive framework for Phase Two vested rights and a phasing plan in conjunction with Providences requested extension of time to build out Phase Two project over an extended period.  Accordingly, the proposed procedural amendment to the Providence Saint Johns Health Center Development Agreement (Attachment C) establishes Council authority over a Phase Two Project Master Plan and defines several of the key issues to be considered in the Master Plan. This procedural amendment, however, does not establish the substantive requirements of the Phase Two Project or the associated Master Plan. Those will be addressed through the process of further developing and finalizing the Phase Two Project Master Plan and bringing that forward through the City review process. "}, "title": " Introduction for First Reading an Ordinance adopting a Development Agreement Amendment 16ENT-0060 Authorizing a Procedural Amendment to the Providence Saint Johns Health Center Development Agreement", "Sponsors": null, "recommendations": [""], "Department": "Design & Preservation (PCD)"}, {"Category": "07.

Administrative Item", "body": {"other": "While there are many benefits of increased visitation, more visitors necessitate an increase in the level of services on the Pier. As a waterfront structure, the Pier itself requires a continually higher level of maintenance and repair as the structure is subjected to the additional stresses caused by increased visitation, climate change, and sea-level rise. Recommendations in the attached documents include physical improvements to enhance the visitors experience, suggestions for new uses and activities that could improve the Piers financial performance, and additional approaches to improve environmental sustainability of the Pier. The objective of the Study was not to prepare a master plan or specific plan (plans that may be needed at a future time), but rather to offer actionable and forward-thinking ideas and priorities that could be implemented by the City incrementally as interest, opportunity, and funding allow. In addition, the Study introduces ideas to be vetted by other formal planning documents and public works initiatives such as the LCP and Pier Bridge EIR analysis.  The Study and SMPC recommendations are aimed to support the Piers continued vibrancy and vitality, as well as promote improved fiscal and environmental sustainability. The Study is not a review of the Piers compliance under the Americans with Disabilities Act Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Title 24 of the California Building Code or any similar law. Should the City adopt some or all of the SMPC board recommendations, SMPC anticipates that the City would perform the required studies to ensure that the recommendations comply with such laws. The SMPC Board understands that not all of the proposed recommendations may be realized, and the recommendations that could be realized may require further study and discussion.  The SMPC Board prepared a Board Recommendations document to serve as a concise companion piece to summarize both the findings in the Study and the Boards experience with the Pier. The Board Recommendations are presented in five categories: 1) Access and Circulation, 2) Uses and Activities, 3) Financial Sustainability, 4) Environmental Sustainability, and 5) Regulatory.  Notable findings in the Study and reaffirmed in the Board Recommendations include the following:          Reduction of Parking on Pier Deck Parking Lot: the vision presented in the Study calls for reducing the parking area to improve the layout of the lot and provide pathways that would better buffer pedestrians from cars. Shrinking the parking area could add dedicated community gathering space while allowing the remainder of the pier deck parking area to be use as flex space that could be used for parking, community programing, or other activities (see page 7 in Attachment A for Opportunity Area Map). The SMPC Board recommends the Pier Deck parking lost in the reconfiguration be relocated to the Deauville Lot north of the Pier. Parking policies set by the LCP would need to be revised to reflect the reduction of parking spaces on the Pier for existing and new uses on the Pier.           Opportunity Areas: the Study identified five activity areas on the Pier where the quality and diversity of activities could be enhanced.  1) Area 1 - Education/Childrens Activity Area: create a family-friendly area adjacent to Ocean Front Walk and the Carousel.  2) Area 2 - Market Place/Event Space Activity Area: create a continuous pedestrian Pier Walk experience with a new ground-level Market Hall, ground-level shops, and a second-level Event Center that would replace the area currently used as the parking lot entrance/exit and back of house maintenance facilities.  3) Area 3 - Recreation and Amusement Activity Area: create a permanent recreational/amusement/spectator use that complements adjacent uses and is capable of improving pedestrian flow.  4) Area 4  Flexible Open-Space-Activity Area: repurpose the west side of the pier parking lot and the eastern edge of Pacific Park to create an important gateway to the amusement activities and create a more positive connection to the parking area as a flexible open space.  5) Area 5 - Vending Cart and Outdoor Dining Zones: create additional vending cart opportunities and outdoor dining extension zones to bring more activity and continuity to pedestrian movement along the length of the Pier Walk.          Pier Bridge Replacement Project - the SMPC continues to endorse the two-bridge proposal (Colorado Avenue and Moss Avenue bridges) which could prioritize pedestrian access and safety by separating pedestrians and bicycles from vehicles and could also unlock new opportunities for activities and uses on the Pier by allowing the Pier to reclaim areas that had previously been used for vehicle movement and parking. However, the SMPC recommendation presents a design refinement to the Pier Bridge Replacement Project and is summarized below.  The SMPC recommends that the two-bridge design should: 1) Incorporate an elevator, escalators, and a staircase within the Colorado Ave Bridge, rather than a ramping system, to enhance multifaceted access to the Pier. The addition of an elevator, escalator, and staircase would better accommodate the continuous and high-volume flow of pedestrians on to and off the Pier.  2) Extend the Colorado Esplanade bike lanes on to the Colorado Avenue Bridge and connect with the Beach Bike Path. Pier Bridge Replacement EIRAn Environmental Impact Report (EIR) analysis of different bridge designs to replace the Pier Bridge is currently underway and will be brought to Council for review and comment at a future date. The preferred alternative in the EIR is a project that replaces the Pier Bridge with a bridge that would serve bikes, pedestrians, emergency vehicles, and limited deliveries, coupled with a second bridge at Moss Avenue to serve vehicles entering the parking area, all in compliance with applicable law and codes. As referenced above, the two-bridge option eliminates the main source of pedestrian/ vehicular conflict on the Pier and would allow the City to reclaim areas previously used for vehicles that could be repurposed with new pedestrian-oriented activities and uses. Options for the Pier BridgeThe EIRs preferred two-bridge option presents two different approaches. The first is a circuitous looping ramping system. The lengthy switchback ramping system requires many ramps and landings for a gradual ascent/decent for ADA compliance. The length of the ramping requires the final landing onto the Pier to occur past the Carousel building. A second option, which the SMPC requests the City evaluate, substitutes the ramping system in favor of an additional structure with an ADA-compliant slope followed by an elevator, escalators, and a staircase to fulfill accessibility requirements while also providing an enhanced pedestrian arrival experience that engages the Carousel.  It should be noted that the Pier Bridge Replacement Project is using federal transportation grant funds for highway bridges. The federal highway-bridge-replacement grant program is administrated by Caltrans on behalf of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Caltrans has determined that the proposed structure containing the elevator/escalator/stairs is not eligible for reimbursement due to reliability concerns in the event of mechanical issues or interruptions. However, Caltrans has indicated that a structural solution, such as a fixed ramping system, would be eligible for reimbursement. Caltrans has agreed to the inclusion of the alternative proposal in the EIR for further consideration, which provides the potential for the City to pursue the proposed non-eligible betterments with City funds. The EIR would also provide the opportunity for FWHA and Caltrans to reconsider whether mechanical systems could be considered reliable. The Citys Disabilities Commission and Commission for the Senior Community Members supported non-mechanical means of accessibility due to the reliability concerns of elevators. Elevators and escalators located in a marine environment could present maintenance and reliability issues, as well as higher operating costs. At the conclusion of the EIR process, if the elevator/escalator refinement is endorsed by Council, additional capital and maintenance funding would be necessary. Council is not being asked to take any action on the Pier Bridge Replacement Project tonight; however, the SMPC recommends that Council consider the elevator/escalator option. The SMPC and staff seek Council comment on the SMPC Board Recommendations. Specific actions and projects may ultimately require CEQA review. Twilight Concert Series (TCS)At its meeting on January 14, 2014 (Attachments C and D), Council discussed the growth in crowd size and public safety challenges associated with the TCS and reviewed modifications to the TCS framework to reposition it as a more community-focused event with minimal beach overflow. The modifications included the following changes:         Limit the crowd capacity on the Pier to approximately 4,000 as determined by the Office of the Fire Marshall         Focus programming on emerging talent, rather than performers with a regional or  national fan base         Remove the jumbotron and speakers on the beach         Revise the layout on the beach to increase public safety control and access As a result of the reduction in crowd size on the Pier, and collaborative efforts between SMPC and the Police and Fire departments, the concert management on the Pier deck improved in 2016 and generally functioned smoothly under the established plan. However, most concert-goers flock to the beach, which has become a regional destination on Thursday evenings. Crowd sizes have increased further since last years arrival of the Expo line. For 2016, public safety staff estimated beach-crowd-size averages of between 15,000 and 20,000 people each week. The elimination of the jumbotron has not deterred attendance. Since most beach-goers are far from the speakers, which have remained, and many are unable to hear the music, staff assumes that many attendees are there mainly to enjoy an evening with friends on the beach. The efforts to book emerging talent have also not been effective at reducing attendance since bands that may be unknown when booked, may become popular by the time of the series. In addition, for many attendees, the band does not matter as they are there for the festive, evening beach experience. The designation of beach lanes and quadrants has helped with public safety; however, the large crowds on the beach continue to challenge public safety personnel and require the assistance of the Los Angeles Sheriffs Department, as well as allied agencies, to fully staff each concert. Traffic within the entire downtown area is severely affected, to the point that last year, the Big Blue Bus was forced to re-route bus service along Fourth Street and to run a shuttle to transfer passengers. The beach is overwhelmed with trash and significant resources are required to clean up the beach after each concert, which defers regular summer beach maintenance. Although more portable restrooms were added in 2016, it is very difficult to provide a sufficient number to accommodate the large crowds. The portable restrooms need to be removed from the beach after each concert and set up the following week by Beach Maintenance staff. The City has continued to receive complaints from neighbors regarding noise, trash, public intoxication, and urination associated with the beach crowds.  Proposed Changes for 2017 TCSFollowing a citywide review of the 2016 series last fall, a smaller group of City staff and SMPC Board members and staff have been meeting regularly since December 2016 to brainstorm ways to reduce public safety costs and minimize the impacts of the popular series on neighbors, the downtown and oceanfront communities, traffic, and the beach. As a result of the discussions, SMPC has agreed to implement the following recommendations for 2017:                     Reduce the number of concerts from ten to eight;          Begin the series in mid-June rather than after July 4th to reduce the strain on resources during the full-peak summer season;         Market the TCS as a green event and develop communications to encourage  attendees to take alternative transportation;          Develop a traffic plan in collaboration with the Citys Transportation Division;          Develop a ride-sharing pick-up and drop-off lot for UBER and LYFT by the EXPO station to keep drivers out of the Ocean/Colorado area;                      Expand the online RSVP system to better gauge crowed size for each concert;         Work with sponsors to develop beach clean-up campaigns, recruit trash ambassadors, and collaborate on solutions for increased restroom facilities; and         Implement an extensive and on-going coordination framework between City staff and Pier Corporation staff and their producers so that crowd sizes, based on talent, can be more accurately estimated. The Citys costs for 2016 were approximately $1 million, primarily for public safety personnel. The SMPC has suggested increasing the number of private security personnel as a way to reduce Police staffing, as well as hiring a third party to audit the crowd size. Decisions on crowd size estimation and deployment are solely the purview of the Police and Fire Chiefs and their staff.  At its February 22, 2017 meeting, the SMPC board approved the expenditure of $200,000 from its budget to fund added private security, additional temporary restroom facilities, and beach clean-up. The new funds supplement the $200,000 Council authorized in 2014 for ongoing funding to the SMPC to support TCS. Staff will recommend an allocation of an additional $600,000 as part of the recommended FY 2017-2019 budget to cover City costs. Staff will return to Council in October or November 2017 to report on the effectiveness of the proposed changes and to seek Council direction regarding the future of the Twilight Concert Series.The Study and the SMPC Board recommendations were unanimously approved by the Santa Monica Pier Board of Directors on December 17, 2015. Since the Boards action, a Study Group of the Board and City staff have met on an ongoing basis to ensure coordination of the findings in the ROMA study and the resulting Board recommendations with both the LCP and Pier Bridge EIR presentations which are planned to be brought to Council later this year.  ", "background": "The Santa Monica Pier is a unique waterfront and historic resource that brings together people from all walks of life. As one of the Citys and regions most enduring and successful public spaces, the Pier serves many functions and uses, including being a public amenity with active and passive recreation and a platform for events, artistic expression, fishing, coastal access, and a connection to history.  The Twilight Concert Series (TCS) was launched nearly four decades ago as part of the effort to bring back the Pier, which had been saved by citizen action from planned demolition. Over that time, it played a key role in that success and become a signature summer series concert tradition, featuring a broad range of musical acts on Thursday nights. It has grown to attract visitors from throughout the Los Angeles area, who enjoy the TCS from the Pier and adjacent beach. That growth has gradually expanded beyond the Pier itself to cover a wide swath of beach to the south. The Piers attractions include commercial enterprises, including an amusement park, arcade, aquarium, and many restaurants, shops, and unique experiences including a historic hippodrome and carousel. It also features the Santa Monica Pier Aquarium, a non-profit educational institution devoted to ocean and environmental science education. Annual visitor counts prior to the opening of Phase 2 of the Expo Light Rail Line were estimated at over seven million people; with the completion of the Expo Line in May of 2016, Pier tenants and Pier staff have reported a substantial increase in Pier visitation.  Context for the Pier Use StudyThe impetus for the Pier Use Study (Study) originated from the Citys and SMPCs interest in proactively identifying how the Pier and its related operations could be updated in light of several transformative projects, starting with the arrival of Phase 2 Expo Line light rail and the completion of Colorado Esplanade, which collectively have increased access and brought thousands more visitors to the Pier on a daily basis. In addition, the upcoming replacement of the Pier Bridge and the update of the Local Coastal Program (LCP) are seen as critical components to enable the City to further reshape the way millions of visitors will access and experience the historic venue and public resource.  The Pier Bridge replacement project and LCP prioritize pedestrian and bicycle access by repurposing areas of the Pier previously devoted to vehicle circulation and parking in favor of other uses. The Pier Bridge replacement project provides the means to minimize conflicts among pedestrians, bicyclists, and automobiles accessing the Pier by creating separate areas for these modes of travel. The LCP is a two-part document that consists of a Land Use Plan (LUP) and an Implementation Plan. The new LUP plan, if adopted by Council and subsequently by the Coastal Commission, would update the 1992 Local Coastal Program Land Use Plan and establish new coastal access policies including parking policies. The Implementation Plan would be a zoning document which sets the land-use standards with which development in the Coastal Zone must comply. The draft Land Use Plan and the draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the Pier Bridge replacement are expected to be presented to Council later this year.  Consultants and Study ProcessROMA Design Group, designer of many notable public spaces including Santa Monicas Third Street Promenade and San Franciscos Ferry Building, was selected to facilitate the public process that paired the consultant teams technical expertise with input from engaged stakeholders and community members. The preparation of the Study was organized around a series of three community workshops hosted by the Santa Monica Pier Corporation on June 3, 2015, September 21, 2015, and December 2, 2015. Upon completion of the Study, the SMPC Board prepared a companion document that distilled ROMAs work in the context of the Boards experience. The companion document that was approved by the Board on December 17, 2015. ", "summary": " The City and Santa Monica Pier Corporation (SMPC) engaged ROMA Design Group to prepare a Pier Use Study (Study) and assist the SMPC with facilitating an intensive eight-month public process to develop a series of realistic and actionable short-term and mid-term recommendations to help the Santa Monica Pier best respond to and leverage the changing environment brought about by the recently completed Phase 2 Expo Line and Colorado Esplanade, as well as the upcoming replacement of the Pier Bridge and the update of the Local Coastal Program (LCP). The emphasis of this effort is to sustain and enhance the character of the Pier as an attractive public environment that continues to welcome locals and visitors of all backgrounds and incomes to share and experience an iconic embodiment of Californias historic heritage, natural environment and cultural diversity.  Additionally, guidance from the SMPC Board is provided in a companion document (Board Recommendations) which summarizes and categorizes the SMPC Boards recommendations reflecting both ROMAs work and the Boards knowledge of the Pier and City practices. The SMPCs expectation is that the Board Recommendations and Study (Attachments A and B) would provide guidance not only on the update of the LCP, but for all matters concerning the Pier.  The Twilight Concert Series (TCS) has grown significantly over the past decade, as have the related impacts to public safety, traffic, the beach, and associated costs. City staff met with board members and staff of the Santa Monica Pier Corporation (SMPC) in 2015 regarding the 2015 and 2016 TCS. They have been meeting again since December 2016 to identify changes for the 2017 series to reduce the adverse impacts and to seek cost reductions to sustain a long-standing community tradition. The changes for 2017 include reducing the number of concerts from ten to eight, beginning the series earlier to avoid the summer peak season, implementing a traffic plan and encouraging attendees to use active transportation, setting up a more extensive and on-going planning and coordination process among City staff, Pier Corporation staff, and event producers, and developing a campaign to reduce the amount of trash on the beach. As part of the proposed FY 2017-2019 budget, staff will recommend an allocation in the amount of $600,000 to cover City-related costs. Staff will return to the Council in fall 2017 with a full report on the TCS series, an evaluation of the changes, and a request for direction regarding the future of the TCS.

Existing facilities were constructed in the 1940s, and since that time the space has been in operation by the City and suffers from worn out infrastructure.  In order to meet entitlement requirements, the City Yards Modernization Project requires environmental compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) including preparation of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) which is due prior to the completion of final design. The EIR would incorporate in its scope the larger conceptual project goals for the City Yards area, including the parking structure, expansion of Gandara Park, Water Resources and Public Landscape facilities, Olympic Treatment Plant and recycling center.  As the design of Phasing Package A commences, a detailed site survey is required to reflect current site conditions. An aerial site survey was completed in 2006 but is no longer an accurate reflection of current site conditions.  The City applied for and was awarded a grant of $1,487,609 from the California Energy Commission to design and develop a multiuser microgrid, known as the Santa Monica Advanced Energy District, which would be based at the City Yards facility. This multiuser microgrid would be designed, developed and incorporated into the City Yards Modernization Project. Arup North America was selected to design the microgrid system based on its technical experience in advanced distributed energy planning and project management, as well as its cost of services. Arup has designed or is designing microgrids and advanced energy systems around the world and has significant expertise in this field. Arup, and its team, will liaise and collaborate with the existing City Yards Modernization design-build contractor, HDCC, to incorporate the additional considerations necessary for a microgrid. Grant funds in the amount of $372,857 would support the additional scope of work and budget for HDCC and its project team beyond what has been proposed in their guaranteed maximum price bid. Consultant Selection (Microgrid)As a general rule, competitive bidding for public entities is a mandatory requirement as provided by statute, charter or ordinance. However, there are certain well recognized exceptions to this rule. By two thirds vote the City Council can waive competitive bidding procedures where the nature of the subject of the contract is such that competitive proposals would be unavailing or would not produce an advantage, and the advertisement for competitive bid would thus be undesirable, impractical, or impossible 9SMMC section 2.24.071(e)(1) and (2).  The City Yards Modernization design contract and grant funding to develop the Santa Monica Advanced Energy District were let after a competitive RFP process.  The proposed microgrid at the City Yards necessitates that Arup works with the existing design-build team (HDCC) for the City Yards Modernization project as the design of the microgrid will be an integral component of the overall electric infrastructure of the City Yards Modernization project. Close coordination will be required between Arup and HDCC as the design of both microgrid and City Yards Modernization will progress concurrently. Existing infrastructure requirements for the City Yards Modernization must be perfectly coordinated and designed to integrate with the proposed microgrid goals such as solar photovoltaics, combined heat and power, energy storage, small-scale waste-to-energy generation, co-generation options and/or electric vehicle-to-grid applications. Bringing in another design team to handle all work for the microgrid without close coordination with the City Yards design-build team would add time and cost to the project.  A separate team would have a steep learning curve, and the coordination of the two scopes of work would be difficult, creating significant cost, time delay, and potential design liability issues to the extent that professional accountability may be difficult to allocate with two designers involved instead of one. It is therefore recommended that the additional microgrid scope be awarded to HDCC, the City Yards Modernization design-build team. Consultant Selection (CEQA Consultant)On October 27, 2015, the City issued RFQ#102715 for environmental consulting services in accordance with City specifications. The RFQ was posted on the Citys on-line bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provisions. The RFQ sought qualifications from environmental consulting firms to prepare environmental documents pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and/or National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). 123 vendors downloaded the RFQ and24 responses were received and evaluated based on the criteria in SMMC 2.24.072, including past experience in urban infill development projects, adequacy of the response, records of past performance, and demonstrated thoroughness in work approach. The City selected 11 qualified firms to be placed on a pre-qualified list based on these criteria. On August 15, 2016, the City issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) to prepare an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the City Yards Modernization Project. The RFP was sent to the 11 pre-qualified firms for environmental consulting services and the following 5 firms responded with submitted proposals:          CAJA Environmental Services, LLC         Dudek         ICF International         LSA Associates, Inc.         Rincon Consultants, Inc. A selection committee consisting of City staff from the divisions of Architecture Services, City Planning, Water Resources and Civil Engineering, reviewed and evaluated all proposals. Evaluation of the submitted materials was based on the selection criteria in SMMC 2.24.073, including:         Training, credentials and prior experience in preparing EIRs for the City of Santa Monica         Competence and knowledge of CEQA regulations         Understanding and experience in related projects, project goals and approach         Understanding of the federal aviation regulations and requirements         Ability of the team to successfully complete the full scope of work on time and within budget         Evidence of a productive team structure and sufficient resources (i.e., financial, staff, etc.)         The firms character and reputation in preparing high quality EIRs in similar municipalities         A budget that reflects a fair, reasonable, and competitive price         Understanding of the specific scope of work of the City Yards Modernization Project Dudek demonstrated the most relevant knowledge of the City and CEQA, had a strong record of preparing legally defensible environmental documentation in the City and other jurisdictions, prepared the most comprehensive scope of work and showcased a flexible approach for the work required. The firm has had recent experience in preparing complicated EIR documentation in the City of Santa Monica, and has demonstrated a strong understanding of the Citys regulatory structure and neighborhood concerns. Furthermore, Dudek has extensive experience in working with water treatment plants and industrial facilities. Based on these criteria, Dudek is recommended as the best proposer. It is anticipated that the CEQA process can be completed within approximately one year. Consultant Selection (Site Survey)On October 26, 2016, the City issued RFP#2396 for site survey services at the City Yards and Gandara Park in accordance with City specifications. The RFP was posted on the Citys on-line bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provisions. 43 vendors downloaded the RFP and the following eight firms responded:         BKF Engineers          Chaundry & Associates         Chris Nelson         D. Woolley & Associates         Hahn & Associates, Inc.          J.O. Nelson          Rosell Surveying & Mapping, Inc.         Towill Inc.  Responses to the RFP were reviewed by a selection panel of staff from the Public Works Department.

A Type 1 Engine has a pump with a 500-gallon water and 50-gallon foam tank. The engines carry hoses, ground ladders, wildland reghting equipment, rope and technical rescue gear, lighting equipment, power tools, medical emergency equipment, and various hand tools. A Type 1 aerial ladder truck is a specialized fire apparatus equipped with an aerial ladder to provide an elevated stream capability and/or a working platform from which rescue or other firefighting related tasks can be performed. The truck also carries an additional compliment of ground ladders, the Jaws of Life tools (Hurst cutter and spreader), lifting airbags, and other technical and extrication equipment. The City replaces heavy Fire apparatus vehicles that have reached the end of their useful life through the Fire Vehicle Replacement Plan within the Capital Improvement Program. The cost effective useful life of an apparatus varies based on geography, utilization, local environment, traffic, starting and stopping periods, workload and maintenance intervals. Apparatus lifespan and replacement intervals are based on several factors including age, mileage, and maintenance costs. The Fire Vehicle Replacement Plan assesses the maintenance to acquisition costs and uses a maintenance to acquisition ratio of 60% for moving a front-line apparatus to reserve status and when apparatus is at 100% is should move from reserve status to retirement. Typical lifespan for a truck and engine is ten years in front-line service and ten years in reserve service. However, the Department is experiencing a need to replace engines at seven to ten years based on a number of lifespan factors. The engines designated for replacement are four 1994 engines and one 2006 engine that are currently used by the Fire Department to respond to all emergency responses. The new engines will be placed into front-line service resulting in the oldest four engines being placed into reserve status. The current reserve engines will be retired. The aerial ladder truck designated for replacement was purchased in 1998. The new aerial ladder truck will be placed into front-line service and the 2006 truck will be moved into reserve status. It is to the Citys advantage to purchase all of these units in one combined order to avoid annual price increases; ensure standardization of fire trucks; save time in preparing a new solicitation; and maximize the opportunity to coordinate pre-construction travel in order to realize savings. Lead-time for building these units is approximately 365 days. The Fire Departments apparatus is highly specialized and has equipment requirements based on response capability to respond to multiple call types. The aerial ladder truck responds to all incidents involving complex technical rescues; it is available for emergency responses resulting from earthquakes and other natural or man-made disasters. In addition, this vehicle will respond to all emergency incidents involving the Expo line train. Unlike other jurisdictions Santa Monica Fire has one aerial ladder truck which requires a tremendous amount of equipment to be able to respond to everything from elevator rescues to incidents involving vehicle entrapments. This response capability requires all equipment to be stored and transported on one truck due to the fact an additional resource is not available within the City. The truck needs to be prepared for all emergency responses and is required to have a large amount of emergency response equipment onboard. The trucks storage compartments are essential for easy access to the emergency response equipment. All engines respond to calls for service at the Advanced Life Support level. Engine companies respond to emergencies ranging from patients in full cardiac arrests to traffic accidents with multiple victims. This also requires full functionality of the storage compartments to meet the operational needs of any type of emergency response. Any reductions in size or configuration of equipment compartments would jeopardize the firefighters ability to carry all of the required equipment to respond to any type of emergency situation. The four fire stations have space limitations based on the height, width, and length of apparatus. The size of the stations limits the dimensions of the replacement apparatus. The size dimensions are also important for the maneuverability of the apparatus based on the citys compact urban environment. The apparatus must be able meet the size specifications identified in the bid requirements. Vendor SelectionIn September 2016, the City published a Notice Inviting Bids for the purchase and delivery of up to two Type 1 Aerial Ladder Trucks and up to five Type 1 Fire Engine vehicles required by the Fire Department in accordance with City specifications. The bid was posted on the Citys on-line bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provisions. A total of twenty-one vendors were notified, of which twenty-one prospective vendors downloaded the bid. Two bids were received and publicly opened on October 13, 2016.

These apparatuses are very technical and complex apparatus and must meet the specifications as identified by the Santa Monica Fire Department. There are only a few companies nationally that can construct such apparatus to meet stringent national, state, and local standards. The Fire Department worked actively with both vendors to identify any bid exceptions and identify any additional costs not included in the original submitted bids. KME was the only vendor able to meet 100% of the specifications on the apparatus size, compartment size, and provide an I-QAN stabilization unit on the aerial ladder truck a required safety mechanism. The size of the engines and truck is paramount due to the width and height constraints of the apparatus bays where the vehicles are kept and KME was the only vendor able to meet these specifications. KME was the only vendor to meet the service center requirements including the required parts inventory and paint and body department. Based on these criteria, KME is recommended as the best bidder. The interoperability consistency of the fleet is also a consideration when awarding the bid. The Big Blue Bus provides ongoing maintenance of the heavy apparatus fleet. The Fire Department has two dedicated mechanics who are trained to service the current fleet. Additional types of apparatus would require additional training and parts at an additional expense. ", "background": "The Santa Monica Fire Department is charged with providing fire suppression, rescue and emergency medical services to its residents and visitors 24 hours a day / 365 days a year.

Additional apparatus that complete the fleet include two Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) vehicles, four Rescue Ambulances and five utility vehicles and sedans. Additionally, the front-line engine fleet is supplemented with four 1994 reserve engines and one 1998 reserve ladder truck. The reserve engines have exceeded their useful life of twenty years and at time of replacement will exceed 23 years of service; the truck will be at the end of its 20 years of service life when the new truck is delivered. It is imperative to have suitable front line apparatus to perform day-to-day response but just as important is a reserve fleet of apparatus to replace front-line apparatus in the event of scheduled preventative maintenance, equipment failure, or strike-team deployment. Based on the Fire Departments apparatus replacement analysis, experience and national standards, every effort is made to acquire and maintain the most reliable, functional and efficient apparatus that meets both the current and predicted needs of the Fire Department.

An evaluation panel comprised of staff from the Economic Development Division reviewed the SOQs. The proposers were evaluated based on the criteria established in the RFQ, including operational capability and experience, references, marketing work plan, fee structure, and ability to execute a lease within a reasonable timeframe. The evaluation panel recommends the selection of Newmark Grubb Knight Frank (NGKF) and its sub-consultant Anthony Chamberlain. NGKF's team leader, Steven Salas, and Mr. Chamberlain each have over 20 years of local real estate experience. Mr. Chamberlain has successfully represented the City in many real estate transactions, including the purchase of the OPCC site at 1751 Cloverfield Boulevard and the sublease of office space at 1630 17th Street.  In addition to the teams knowledge of and experience with the local office market and prospective tenants, the City also would benefit from NGKFs global network. NGKF is a multinational real estate service firm that is able to market the building to local, national, and international clients. The broad exposure should assist in locating a qualified tenant and generating maximum market rent for the building. Staff recommends entering into a professional services agreement for a term of one-year with a one-year option in an amount not to exceed $310,000. The agreement would include a contractual term for compensation, in the form of a commission, paid to the brokers upon the City executing a contract with a tenant. Real estate commissions are typically paid by the landlord to the brokers representing the landlord and prospective tenant and are typically a one-time payment equal to five or six percent of the rent anticipated for the primary rental term of the lease. For example, if the negotiated rental rate is $5.00 per square foot with a lease term of 5 years, then the commission amount, at a 6 percent commission rate, would be $307,800. The actual amount of the commission is unknown at this time.  A request for qualifications (RFQ) was released on October 27, 2016, posted on PlanetBids (the City's online bidding site), and advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press.

Staff had determined that the 5th Street building was not suitable for City occupancy. The use of a real estate broker improves the marketing and exposure of the property and increases access to a greater number of prospective tenants who are interested in leasing office space.  Council could decide not to utilize a broker to represent the City to lease the space at 1632 5th Street.

The facility is comprised of temporary trailers that have been in service for over 30 years, and are used on a daily basis to train Santa Monica and other local municipalitys fire fighters.  The lot where the existing training center is situated was deemed unsuitable as a long-term solution for the new facility due to its proximity and the effects of being located over a landfill. Over time the soils have settled unevenly and have caused problems at the existing training center which required costly repairs. As part of the City Yards Master Plan, the site for the training center trailers were moved to a new location in a reconfigured fire training yard area. In the master plan, this work is identified as phase 0, or work that must be completed prior to the start of construction on the larger project. Design of the first phase of the City Yards Modernization is anticipated to commence in the beginning of 2017, with construction anticipated to be completed in 2021. Staff reviewed various options for the new training center site and determined the lot currently occupied by the no longer functioning trash transfer pit and its adjacent lot as the best alternative for the new City Yards Fire Department Training Center. This area has an existing eight-inch thick concrete slab, which would provide sufficient foundation support and negates the need for expensive foundation repair to occur. Another advantage to relocating the new training center at this area is that the majority of construction would occur outside of the existing Fire Department training yard and would not interfere with current fire training and academy schedules during construction.  Improvements to two areas are required in order to prepare for the installation of the new modular buildings. First, a cement-block wall would be demolished to allow direct access from the training yard side into the new training center. The trash transfer pit would need to be demolished, backfilled and new pavement installed for use by the Fire Departments ladder truck that would station next to the training center. Utilities such as water, sewer, gas and electrical would need to be installed. Second, the service vehicles currently parked in the lot would be relocated to the former Flap Happy site at 2330 Michigan Avenue, which would require a new gate and restriping for the modified parking layout.  Vendor SelectionOn October 11, 2016, the City published Notices Inviting Bids to furnish and provide construction services in accordance with City specifications.

This code section currently does not include the Santa Monica Swim Center, a highly utilized City-owned facility that offers a full range of community programs, including swim lessons, fitness classes, lifeguard training, and special events throughout the year. Due to the omission of the Swim Center from SMMC 4.55.400, currently all modifications to the facilitys operating rules and regulations require Council approval. Staff recommends that Council delegate authority to the Director of CCS to promulgate rules and regulations for the Swim Center as needed to ensure public safety and continued enjoyment of the facility.  Interim Airport Open SpacePer Councils direction to staff on March 24, 2015 (Attachments F and G), schematic design is currently underway to expand Airport Park on two six-acre parcels of non-aviation land at Santa Monica Airport. On September 27, 2016, Council reviewed and adopted a motion to approve the conceptual direction for this project (Attachment H). At that time, staff indicated they would return to Council  with proposed guidelines and regulations to facilitate temporary recreational use of a portion of the Airport Park Expansion site (the vacant 6-acre eastern parcel) until construction of the permanent park commences. Staff has included a draft of the proposed rules and regulations for Councils review (Attachment I) and recommends that Council add promulgating rules and regulations for the Interim Airport Open Space to the Director of CCSs authority under SMMC 4.55.400. ", "summary": "Staff is proposing amendments to the Santa Monica Municipal Code (SMMC) Sections 4.04.162, 4.55.010, 4.55.020 and 4.55.400, including:1.     Expanding the list of exotic and wild animal species prohibited from the Beach, Ocean Front Walk, the Pier and Pier ramp, the Third Street Promenade, the Downtown Transit Mall, and all City parks and adjacent sidewalks in SMMC 4.04.162 to include arachnids (e.g. spiders and scorpions), rodentia (rodents), lagomorpha (rabbits, hares, and pikas); 2.     Adding the Citys newest park, Ishihara Park, and five parcels of existing open space on Ocean Park Boulevard (Ocean Park Green Space) to SMMC 4.55.020;3.

Ordinances", "body": {"other": "Home-Sharing brings benefits to residents who utilize their homes to host visitors. The activity makes efficient use of space by allowing residents to host guests in a room or unit when the room or unit might otherwise not be used. Because vacation rentals typically do not have the owner present at the same time as a guest, they effectively function as a hotel room with a guest having exclusive use of a residential dwelling unit for a short-term stay. They have the potential to have greater impacts on neighborhoods and residents and can change the character of neighborhoods by bringing commercial activities and removing residential housing stock from the market.  With the adoption of Chapter 6.20, City Council sought to create regulations to assist with removing and preventing vacation rentals while authorizing home-sharing activities. Santa Monica, as most every other city faced with the challenge of regulating vacation rentals and home-sharing, continues to face strong resistance from Hosting Platforms. In fact, Hosting Platforms have sued or threatened to sue a number of cities.  Existing rules and regulations require a host to register with the City by applying for and obtaining a business license. A host must complete the Home-Sharing Registration Packet which is available to applicants on the Citys website. Staff reviews the application for compliance with established rules and regulations and if approved, the applicant is provided a business license. This process serves to register all hosts. There are no fees to register and no inspections or regulatory permits are required. Additionally, the City currently makes available, through the Citys Open Data Portal, a list of all home-shares registered with the City and licensed to operate as a business license category, unless a host chooses to opt out from being listed.  In light of recent court rulings, staff has reviewed Chapter 6.20 to consider whether provisions of the law can be strengthened to assist in achieving the laws objective. Staff is therefore proposing some minor amendments to clarify some terms and requirements related to the creation of a home-sharing registry and the publishing of that registry. While a host may currently opt out of being listed, the proposed law would require that all City approved hosts be included in the registry list and that the list would be publicly available. Proposed AmendmentsThe proposed amendments, which are included in the amended ordinance as Attachment B, would establish more explicit language that would require that a home-sharing host be registered with the City, and would further require the City to publish a list of all registered hosts. Consistent with existing practice, if a host fails to register they would be subject to enforcement action, including a citation up to $500 and referral to the City Attorneys Office for criminal prosecution. The proposed amendments also clarify that hosting platforms are not responsible for inspecting units for compliance with Building and Fire Codes.  Staff would be responsible for preparing the registry, publishing it, and providing copies to hosting platforms such as Airbnb upon request. The requirements of the proposed law to create a registry and make it available are already established practice and would not require any operational changes to comply; and although a list of all registered hosts has been available online as part of the list of business licenses within the City, staff will create a specific list of registered home-shares on the Citys Open Data Portal at data.smgov.net, under the category of permits and licensing. The list of data will be called Home-Sharing Registry. The proposed ordinance would prohibit hosting platforms from completing transactions for any short-term rentals which are not listed on the City registry. This would facilitate a hosting platforms compliance with the law by preventing unlawful rentals. So long as a hosting platform is in compliance with its responsibilities for collecting and remitting TOT, and it only completes booking transactions for City-approved and registered units, it will be deemed in compliance with the ordinance. Internet companies which do not charge for booking services, and act solely as publishers of advertisements for short term rentals would not be subject to the amended ordinance.  The proposed changes would not have a material impact on the procedures currently in place for Home-Sharing enforcement. ", "background": "Section 9.51.030(B)(15)(c) of the Zoning Ordinance (ZO) defines vacation rentals as:A property with a dwelling unit or guest house intended for permanent occupancy that is available for rent or hire for any person other than the primary owner for transient use for 30 days or less or is otherwise occupied or utilized on a transient basis for 30 days or less. The ZO makes clear that a vacation rental is not a bed and breakfast, for which detailed conditions are set forth in Section 9.31.090 and where a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) is usually required. Additionally, the ZO, continuing a multi-decade prohibition, does not authorize Vacation Rentals in any part of the City.  On May 12, 2015, the City Council adopted Chapter 6.20 (aka Home-Sharing Ordinance) defining the following two distinct types of short-term rentals of 30 days or less in private residential dwelling units (see Attachment A).  1. Vacation Rental. The exclusive rental of a private residence for transient use. In such cases the resident is either not present or there is no full time resident that lives in the unit.2. Home-Sharing. The rental of a persons private residence while the primary occupant is present during the rental and whereby the person is hosting the visitor. Consistent with the ZO, Chapter 6.20 explicitly prohibited Vacation Rentals in the City but authorized Home-Sharing. Since the ZO does not address Home-Sharing, Chapter 6.20 was adopted to preempt the ZO when there are conflicts between the provisions of the ordinances. Chapter 6.20 defines Hosting Platforms as, a marketplace in whatever form or format which facilitates the home-sharing or vacation rental, through advertising, match-making or any other means, using any medium of facilitation, and from which the operator of the hosting platform derives revenues, including booking fees or advertising revenues, from providing or maintaining the marketplace. Hosting Platforms are responsible for the collection of Transient Occupancy Tax as an agent of a Host. The law also requires Hosting Platforms to disclose information regarding rentals and does not allow them to facilitate or advertise any unlawful Home-Sharing activities. ", "summary": "The proposed amendments will clarify that internet companies that serve as hosting platforms and charge a fee for facilitating short term rental transactions will be responsible for collecting Transient Occupancy Taxes (TOT) and held accountable for booking illegal rentals, while hosts and property management companies must comply with all aspects of the ordinance.

TRM Services would provide plumbing services for large-scale projects that are often long-term and require specialized licensing and equipment, such as boiler rehabilitations, water and sewer line replacements, and installation of plumbing fixtures. Horns Backflow would provide plumbing services for minor urgent and after-hour repairs such as drain cleanouts, storm drain stoppages and fixture leaks. Staffs recommendation is to award the bid to two plumbing contractors to allow continuous and immediate availability as plumbing emergencies often involve sanitation and water supply issues, which directly impact public health.  Vendor/Consultant SelectionOn May 9, 2017, the City published Notices Inviting Bids for citywide plumbing contractor services that included multi-year renewal options in accordance with City specifications. The bid was posted on the City's on-line bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code Section 2.24.100(a).

Bids were evaluated based on the criteria in SMMC 2.24.072, including price, previous experience, ability to deliver, quality of product, and compliance with City specifications. Neither TRM Services nor Horns Backflow is the lowest bidder when considering the hourly labor rates, but both offered competitive pricing, the fastest guaranteed response times and lowest pricing for renewal options. Moreover, both recommended bidders have previously provided the City with responsive and satisfactory service. Amgreen Solutions offered the lowest hourly labor rate, but its pricing is significantly lower than the established Prevailing Wage rates required by state law, demonstrating non-compliance and thus its bid was inadmissible. Based on these criteria, staff recommends TRM Services and Horns Backflow as the best bidders. As both bid awards are subject to prevailing wage rates, the recommended cumulative not to exceed amount has increased from the previous contracted amount by approximately 30 percent. The cumulative not to exceed amount increase is also attributed to the additional two-year renewal option.", "background": "The City employs four permanent in-house plumbers, including one plumber crew leader, to provide various plumbing services at City facilities.

Staff contracts out the more difficult graffiti removals to ensure safety and community wellbeing. The City contracts out graffiti removals on properties over two stories high with minimal landing to ensure the safety of City staff. The City also contracts out urgent removals of gang-related or inflammatory graffiti to prevent additional tagging that could occur if the graffiti were not promptly removed. By augmenting in-house graffiti removal services with contracted services, the City has kept the response time to less than 24 business hours. In many cases, tags are removed within one hour.  In 2015, one additional graffiti removal technician position was approved as part of the Contract and As-Needed Staffing Review: Policy, Practice, & Recommendations report (Attachment B), increasing the number of in-house graffiti removal technician positions to four. However, consecutive retirements followed the approval of an additional graffiti removal technician, reducing the amount of full-time graffiti technicians to two and necessitating graffiti removal contract services. The four graffiti removal technician positions became fully staffed in January 2017. However, City trucks used by the crew are not equipped with mounted pressure washing capabilities to tackle graffiti tags that are more difficult to remove, another reason the Facilities Maintenance Division has used contractor services. Vendor SelectionOn May 25, 2017, the City published Notices Inviting Bids to provide citywide graffiti removal services in accordance with City specifications.

Although Graffiti Control Systems Services bid is $14,352 higher, they offered a faster response time and have experience with the online Tracking Automated and Graffiti Reporting System (TAGRS). Graffiti Control Systems Services offered a 30-minute response time for emergency graffiti removal requests, while the other bidder, AES Property Services, offered a 24-hour response time. Immediate graffiti removal is essential as tags are often derogatory and tend to attract additional tagging when not promptly removed. Graffiti Control Systems Services also has experience with TAGRS, which is a database where graffiti can be photographed, recorded, and tracked for quick analysis and subject identification. AES Property Services does not have any experience with TAGRS. Staff recommends that the City continues to utilize TAGRS to support enforcement efforts against graffiti tagging. Based on the faster response time and direct experience with TAGRS, Graffiti Control Systems Services is recommended as the best bidder. The contract to be awarded to Graffiti Control Systems Services would be based on 16 hours per week (two eight-hour days), at prevailing wage rates, plus contingency for as-needed service calls and urgent removals.  ", "background": "The City removes graffiti from all buildings and infrastructure.

Some of the contract locations require consistent but limited number of service hours, where other sites, such as the Pier, require year-round in-house and contract staffing as well as additional contract staffing during peak seasons. Lees Maintenance Services (Lees) has been providing custodial services at the above contract sites since 2014. Affordable Care ActSigned into law in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, is a federal mandate that requires employers with at least 50 full-time equivalent employees to offer affordable, minimum value health coverage to their full-time employees. When Lees first started providing custodial services to the City, no federal guidelines existed for small businesses to comply with the ACA. Subsequently, the federal government released further ACA compliance instructions, and Lees began providing health insurance to its qualified custodians in March 2016. The City agreed to reimburse Lees for the health insurance costs of its eligible custodians assigned full-time to City job sites using the contracts contingency fund to cover the additional expenses.  At the time of this report, $81,833 has been expended on ACA payments. While Lees has been providing satisfactory services to the City and the current contract provides renewal options through June 2020, staff decided it would be prudent to evaluate custodial services options available in the current marketplace by going out to bid.

Based on these criteria, UNISERVE Facilities Services Corp., the lowest bidder, is recommended as the best bidder. In addition to being the lowest bidder, UNISERVE has demonstrated superb industry experience and capacity as well as a strong commitment to employee training, service quality assurance, and established professional practices.  Founded in 1966, UNISERVE has been delivering custodial services to Fortune 1000 companies, airports, museums, and government entities for over five decades. The company has large, long-term custodial accounts, which includes FedEx, the Getty Center, the Getty Villa, and the City of Los Angeles. Specifically, the City of Los Angeles provided an excellent reference and attested to the companys capability to handle a wide variety of job sites that are similar to those in the City of Santa Monica. Additionally, the company provides ACA health insurance and the Citys current Living Wage of $15.87 per hour (adjusted annually per the Consumer Price Index) to all of its employees assigned to City sites. Finally, although not a bid requirement, UNISERVEs proposal to provide a 100% dedicated account manager for the City illustrates the companys commitment to customer care and quality assurance.  Based on these criteria, staff recommends that Council award bid #4272 to UNISERVE Facilities Services Corp. for custodial services at various City locations for a five-year amount not to exceed $7,713,321. The first contract year and first renewal option have a not-to-exceed amount of $1,488,016 per year. The subsequent three renewal options are subject to an increase based on the Citys Living Wage Ordinance. Service Continuity and SustainabilityThere will be no interruption of service during the transition period. Lees will continue to provide custodial services at all contract locations on a month-to-month basis with a 30-day termination notice until the new contract with UNISERVE is in place. UNISERVE will comply with the California Displaced Janitor Opportunity Act and the Citys requirement to retain existing custodians employed by the previous contractor to ensure continuity in employment and service level. UNISERVE will continue to use environmentally sensitive, low toxicity cleaning products that are supplied by the City and pre-approved by Risk Management and the Office of Sustainability and Environment to ensure the health of staff, the public, and the environment.  AlternativeIf the City were to provide the same level of custodial services using in-house personnel, staff estimates a cost difference of $3.65 million, or 56% more, in staffing costs alone over the course of five years compared with utilizing services from UNISERVE (Attachment D). Bringing custodial services in-house for the contract locations would incur additional salaries and benefits of $1.96 million in the first year (plus potential cost of living and benefit premium increases for subsequent years) and the hiring of an additional 22.4 FTE Custodians and 2 FTE Custodial Supervisors. This does not include significant initial investment for vehicles, tenant improvement for additional office spaces, office equipment, cleaning equipment, and uniform purchases, as well as ongoing expenses in City overhead, training, overtime incurred by backfilling vacation and sick leaves, and maintenance/replacement of vehicles, equipment, and supplies.  In addition to the fiscal impact, changing the current service model and creating additional permanent positions at this time would have a negative operational impact by: A) reducing workforce flexibility at locations where service demand is seasonal, such as the Santa Monica Pier and the additional service level required during the popular Twilight Concert Series every summer; B) limiting the Citys options to redefine or adjust service levels when City staff currently working in leased office spaces move into the new City Services Building in the foreseeable future; and C) increasing administrative complications and the span of supervision for the Custodial Services Section, including recruitment, staff training, performance evaluations, disciplinary actions, and workers compensation risk.  ", "background": "Historically, the City has adopted a hybrid service model of utilizing in-house and contract custodial services to clean various City-owned and City-leased locations in order to minimize service interruptions at busy locations and maximize workforce flexibility at sites with dynamic, seasonal demands.

Upgrades in Area 4 of the Newcomb Pier (See Attachment 1 for Area 4 Location) is considered one of the higher priority structural upgrade zones along the Newcomb Pier. The limits of this area are bounded by Bent 12 to the east, Bent 16 to the west, an existing building to the north and the edge of the Pier to the south. In this zone, the stringers (which support the decking) are 3 inches by 16 inches at 22 inches on-center directly below the existing 3-inch wood decking. The calculated loading capacity for the existing structural components in this area are capable of supporting a 7-ton vehicle. In order to achieve the recommended capacity to support an H-15 truck, existing stringers need to be supplemented. New 4-inch by 16-inch stringers would be added between existing stringers. In addition, new 3-inch decking would replace the existing substandard decking in this area. The railing and light poles on the pier are subject to significant environmental challenges with salt air and humidity.

Section 15301(c) exempts Class 1 projects consisting of the \"operation, repair, maintenance, permitting, leasing, licensing, or minor alteration of existing public or private structures, facilities, mechanical equipment, or topographical features, involving negligible or no expansion of use beyond that existing at the time of the lead agencys determination.\" This exemption includes: Existing highways and streets, sidewalks, gutters, bicycle and pedestrian trails, and similar facilities.\" Section 15302 exempts Class 2 projects consisting of the replacement or reconstruction of existing structures and facilities. The project's replacement of the existing railings with new railings; replacement of four corroded light poles and new lights, and replacement of the decking area 4 at the Santa Monica Pier qualifies as Class 1 and 2 projects exempt from CEQA. In addition, none of the exceptions specified in Section 15300.2 of CEQA Guidelines would apply that would preclude the use of this CEQA exemption: The project site is not located in a sensitive environment; the project will not have a significant effect on the environment; the project would not damage scenic resources; the project would not be located on a hazardous waste site; and the project would not cause a change to a historical resource including the Santa Monica Pier as all replacements will be replacements-in-kind. Therefore, this project is categorically exempt from CEQA.    Contractor Selection On June 26, 2017, the City published Bid #SP2465 for construction services for the Santa Monica Municipal Pier Railing and Lighting Replacement and Area 4 Deck Upgrade Projects. The bid was posted on the Citys on-line bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Santa Monica Municipal Code Section 2.24.071(a) provisions. A total of 52 vendors downloaded the bid. Two bids were received and publically opened on July 26, 2017.

Staff recommends John S. Meek Company, Inc., the lowest bidder, as the best bidder based on price, quality of services offered and experience with similar projects. John S. Meek Company, Inc. provided four references for recently completed projects, and a similar number of ongoing projects. All references contacted reported that the work performed by John S. Meek Company, Inc. was completed in a timely and cost-effective manner while maintaining consistent quality. John S Meek Company, Inc. has completed several projects for the Santa Monica Pier over the years, and staff is very pleased with their performance and professionalism. The Contractors State License Board also verified that the contractor and subcontractors licenses are current, active and in good standing. Construction Management Construction management and public outreach for this project would be provided by City staff. Construction management would include inspecting the contractor's work during construction, verifying and documenting field changes and unforeseen conditions, monitoring and mitigating impacts as a result of the construction activities, attending the contractor's safety meetings, attending periodic progress meetings and maintaining all necessary inspection documentation relevant to the work conducted during construction.  Public OutreachEngineering staff met with the Pier Management staff, Pier businesses, Pier Corporation staff and the Pier Board about upcoming Pier projects in March and April 2017. At these public outreach meetings, staff presented preconstruction activities, project team roles, preliminary schedules and preliminary cost estimates for the upcoming project. Staff will continue to communicate with Pier tenants regarding all pre-construction public outreach while fostering open lines of communication and responding to the day to day concerns of the community, visitors and local businesses. Public outreach during construction of this project would be provided by the City and supplemented by the Citys communications consultant CALTROP as part of the Contract for Pier Electrical Upgrade Project. The consultant is currently preparing and implementing a public information plan for this project and the Pier Electrical Upgrade Project. During construction, the construction management team would foster open lines of communication to receive feedback from the public and disseminate project information, ensuring constant outreach to the public, Pier tenants and other stakeholders. Public outreach would include notifications distributed to adjacent properties and the surrounding community on the scope of the project, potential impacts and the schedule, with additional periodic updates. Construction TimelineUpon Council approval, staff anticipates that construction would begin in January 2018 and would be completed by June 2018. To mitigate construction impacts to the Pier patrons, the project will implement early working hours commencing at 6 a.m. Monday to Friday and on Saturdays as needed. Early starts will help complete work earlier in a given day, thus mitigating impacts to Pier patrons in the afternoons. ", "background": "The Santa Monica Municipal Pier is over 100 years old and is an iconic destination where traditional, athletic and educational events are programmed throughout the year.

Customers can also request a change in containers due to changes in service. The plastic bins are manufactured with medium- or high-density polyethylene material, which allows them to be practically maintenance free: they do not dent, rust or require painting. Since the plastic bins are more desirable due to their lightweight design, which may reduce employee injuries and noise issues, staff is proposing a 70/30 mix (plastic to metal) in the bin inventory. Complete elimination of the metal bins is not recommended as the metal bins have a smaller width and footprint, which allows for placement in smaller enclosure areas or at alley locations where space is more compact.  This award would enable staff to provide approximately 700 bins in the first year and 320 annually thereafter, totaling 1,980 bins over the five-year period. To date, the number of metal bins replaced by plastic is 1,330.  Approximately $625,000 would be required for the purchase of the plastic bins in FY 2017-18.

While this objective is still important, the conditions at the Pier and beach have changed and there is no longer an off season. The demand for parking for Pier and beach visitors is strong year-round, and the preferred time period for larger events is January through March. Pier tenants have long advocated for untimed exhibitions, rather than timed performances, since there is more chance that patrons coming to an exhibition for an hour may also visit the Pier than those who attend a three-hour performance.

The RFP was posted on the Citys on-line bidding website. Five hundred eighty-five vendors were notified; thirty-three vendors downloaded the RFP. Film Independent was the only firm to submit a proposal. Staff subsequently determined that the RFP had not been advertised in the local press, as required by the Municipal Code, and re-issued the RFP on January 30, 2017, posted it on the Citys online bidding website, and a notice was advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press. Eight hundred sixty-one vendors were notified; fifty-four downloaded the RFP. Film Independent was again the only firm to submit a proposal.  The RFP included the provision to submit a proposal for an event that occurs at the same time each year for up to three years. Film Independent s proposal covers the ISA in 2018, 2019, and 2020. The RFP was reviewed by a selection committee of staff from Community and Cultural Services, Office of Pier Management, Santa Monica Pier Corporation and Santa Monica Travel and Tourism. After two successful years in the 1550 lot, and consultation with both the SMPC and the Pier lessees, staff is recommending that ISA return for the next three years.

The bids were posted on the Citys on-line bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code Section 2.24.100(a). No bids were received in September. Two bids were received and publicly opened on October 22, 2013, per Attachment A. Bids were evaluated on price, product availability, selection, quality of material, and compliance with City specifications. Byron Woodley Tire was the lowest bidder based on historical and projected use of various tire sizes and the prices for each tire size as listed in Attachment A; provided all of the requested tire types and services such as flat repairs; and has a history of satisfactory performance with the City. Based on these criteria, Byron Woodley Tire was recommended as the best bidder for the purchase and delivery of passenger and light-duty vehicle tires and provision of related services. On January 14, 2014 (Attachment B), the City Council awarded Bid No. 4119 to Byron Woodley Tire in an amount not to exceed $40,000 for the remainder of FY 2013-14, with two one-year options for $85,000 per year to renew at the same price, terms, and conditions, for a total award amount not to exceed $210,000 over a three-year period, with future funding contingent on Council budget approval. Staff recommends that the City Council authorize the Purchasing Services Manager to increase the purchase order amount with Byron Woodley Tire by an additional $213,332 and extend the purchase order for an additional one-and-a-half years through January 14, 2019, with future year funding contingent on Council budget approval.  ", "background": "The Fleet Management Division is responsible for ensuring that City vehicles and other automotive-related equipment are available, dependable and safe to operate.

Consent Calendar", "body": {"other": "City of Santa Monica Sustainable Water Infrastructure Project (SWIP)The SWIP is composed of three integrated project elements to help improve drought resiliency, increase water supply and enhance flexibility in the management of the Citys water resources.         SWIP Element 1 is the installation of a containerized brackish/saline reverse osmosis and enhanced disinfection at the SMURRF. When operational, the reverse osmosis/disinfection unit would be utilized to advance treat non-conventional water resources such as urban and wet weather runoff harvested by the separate and recently approved Clean Beaches Initiative (CBI) Project to be constructed below ground at the Deauville Parking Lot. The CBI stormwater harvest tank would capture runoff from the 106-acre Pier Drainage Area that would normally be discharged to the ocean at the Pier Outfall. When runoff is scarce, the tank would be replenished with brackish groundwater collected from shallow horizontal sub drains installed beneath the CBI stormwater tank. This water would also be treated for reuse at the SMURRF.            SWIP Element 2 includes the construction of a below ground Advanced Water Treatment Facility (AWTF) at a location beneath the Civic Center Parking Lot. The AWTF would advance treat approximately 1.0 MGD of municipal wastewater for reuse. Treatment processes would include, among other things, a membrane bio-reactor, membrane filtration, reverse osmosis and advanced oxidation.          SWIP Element 3 consists of two below-grade stormwater harvest tanks. One tank (3.0 MG) would be constructed beneath Memorial Park. The other below-grade tank (1.5 MG) would be located adjacent to the AWTF described in SWIP Element 2 above. Project elements to be located under the Civic Center Parking Lot would be constructed to accommodate future development on the site. The harvested stormwater would be used as a supplemental feed source for treatment at the AWTF described in Element 2 above. Benefits provided by the stormwater harvest tanks include capturing stormwater and urban runoff for treatment and reuse, improving beach water quality and complying with State Water Board Enhanced Watershed Management Plan (EWMP) requirements. Together, the Project elements would produce approximately 1.5 MGD (1,680 acre-feet/year) of new water for immediate non-potable reuse, and when appropriately permitted, for indirect potable reuse via aquifer recharge. All treated water would be distributed via the Citys existing non-potable water purple pipe system. The proposed locations of project elements 1, 2 and 3 are shown in Attachment E. The estimated cost of the SWIP is $69,893,435. The State Water Board has reviewed the Citys CWSRF application and provided a preliminary funding agreement to the City in the principal amount of $56,885,903 for a 30-year term, low-interest loan. The preliminary CWSRF agreement also provides for $4.0M in principal forgiveness, contingent on project completion. The preliminary funding agreement has been reviewed by staff and is recommended for approval. The interest rate for the SWIP CWSRF loan would be 1.8% per annum. The City would utilize the Wastewater (31) Fund to service the CWSRF debt, estimated at $2,298,945 annually for 30 years starting in FY 2020/2021.  As modeled in the Citys 5-year fund forecast, no sewer service charge rate increases are planned through calendar year 2019.  Pending a rate study to be completed in 2019 to set water and sewer rates for calendar years 2020 to 2024, the City currently anticipates that the annual SWIP debt service will be able to be accommodated by the Wastewater Fund with sewer service charge rate increases in line with CPI during the next rate study period. Other City financial sources that would be utilized to fund construction of the SWIP include the Clean Beaches and Ocean Parcel Tax (06) Fundand the Stormwater Management (34) Fund. Separate from the CWSRF financing, the City will apply for stormwater grant funds from Round 2 of Proposition 1 in late 2018. Although not currently necessary to complete construction, if the Round 2 of Proposition 1 stormwater grant application is successful, these monies, which would reportedly become available in 2019, could ultimately help reduce the total amount of CWSRF financing required to complete the SWIP.  Environmental AnalysisThe California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Mitigated Negative Declaration, the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documents (i.e. CEQA-Plus) for the project were certified by the Santa Monica City Council on September 27, 2016, and the Notice of Determination was filed at the State Clearinghouse on September 30, 2016 (Attachment F). The SWIP project was also presented to the Water Advisory Committee on May 23, 2016 and the Citys Task Force on the Environment on June 20, 2016. Next StepsA competitive bid selection process would be initiated for the design-build contractor upon notification by the State Water Board that the SWIP CWSRF monies are available for use. Staff would bring a recommendation for contract award to City Council for review upon completing the design-build contract competitive bid process. A team of builders, designers and specialty consultants would provide expertise at this critical phase of design and cost estimating. Members of this integrated project team would likely include construction specialists, architects, engineers, archaeological and historical consultants, and cost estimators. Upon Councils approval, the design-build team could move into the construction phase based on a guaranteed maximum price. Once the SWIP recycled water treatment plant is completed, the design-build team would be required to operate the facility for a minimum required duration to demonstrate the facility performance as per the Citys requirement as well as to obtain permits required by the State Water Board and DDW.  Authorization for a SWIP Owners EngineerThe SWIP will include the one of a kind construction of a completely below ground advance water treatment facility. The technical challenges presented by the project location and construction require specialized engineering expertise. The SWIP Owners Engineer would provide engineering and technical expertise to the City on this project, help develop the scope of the work with the design-build contractor, and facilitate state and water board approvals of this project. Vendor/Consultant SelectionThe City published an RFP for an Owners Engineer for the SWIP on July 20, 2017.  The RFP was posted on the Citys on-line bidding site for 22 days, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provisions. A total of 91 vendors downloaded the RFP. One firm, MWH/Stantec, responded.  Staff recommends proceeding with MWH/Stantec based on the criteria in SMMC 2.24.073 as well as the following criteria: experience / technical competence, ability to meet work plan / timelines, quality control, stability / references and value added - breadth of service.  The term of the subject contract is five years with an amount not to exceed $1,649,920. In the past MWH/Stantec has performed following services for the City on the SWIP; professional engineering services for siting and feasibility study, supplemental technical reports, recycled plant process design, cost estimating, influent/effluent water quality determination, project technical and design reports.  The estimated cost of the SWIP is $69,893,435. The project cost estimate includes services for an Owners Engineer. The State Water Board CWSRF is providing $56,885,903, including $4.0M in debt forgiveness on the sum of CWSRF monies utilized for project completion. The Clean Beaches and Ocean Parcel Tax (06) Fund would contribute $4.5M, the Stormwater Management (34) Fund would contribute $1.4M and the Wastewater (31) Fund would contribute approximately $7.1M. The terms of the CWSRF are 30 years at 1.8% per annum. Estimated annual debt service is $2,298,945. The Wastewater (31) Fund would be pledged to service the CWSRF debt. ", "background": "Partnership with StateThe State Water Board is committed to assisting its stakeholders in building resiliency to drought and climate change. Similarly, the City has established among its sustainability goals the objective of reaching water self-sufficiency by the year 2020, concurrent with addressing the water conservation measures made necessary by drought influenced impacts to groundwater (Attachment A). The Citys SWIP would align with these objectives while simultaneously increasing water supply for reuse and enhancing flexibility in the management of the Citys water resources.  Council has taken action three times to help move this SWIP project and the partnership with the State forward. On January 26, 2016, City Council adopted a resolution that authorized the submittal of an application for funding consideration from the State Water Board in the amount of up to $57,050,000 from the CWSRF and State Proposition 1 funding programs, and authorized the City Manager to execute all necessary documents to apply and negotiate for funding (Attachment B). On September 27, 2016, City Council adopted a resolution certifying the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Mitigated Negative Declaration for the SWIP as well as the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program (Attachment C). On December 6, 2016, City Council adopted a resolution approving pledged revenues and reimbursement of any State CWSRF financing if accepted by the City (Attachment D). The action here would enable the City to formalize the agreement with the State and secure funding for the project. Project ApproachStaff has implemented a two-phase approach for the SWIP project. The first phase, which is complete, was project concept development. Phase I included, among other things, obtaining CWSRF loan funding, concept development, feasibility, permitting, obtaining environmental clearance, initiation of the aquifer recharge permitting process with the State Water Board and State Division of Drinking Water (DDW), development process design, and influent/effluent water quality criteria.  Phase II is project implementation. Staff has determined that a design-build process would best serve the Citys needs due to the complexity of the SWIP below-grade construction and CWSRF deadlines, which expect project construction to be complete by the end of 2020. The design-build approach is the most common project delivery method for water/wastewater facilities. It offers efficient project delivery, diverse expertise, team member continuity and accountability. This is a trusted approach used by the City in recent years to design and build a number of projects, including the Arcadia & Charnock Water Treatment Plants, the Big Blue Bus Facility Expansion, the Main Library construction, and the Tongva Park and Ken Genser Square projects. ", "summary": "The City has proposed the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Project (SWIP) to help meet the Citys objective of water self-sufficiency by the year 2020. Water sustainability cannot rely on local groundwater alone. To achieve long-term water sustainability, the City will need to harvest and treat non-conventional resources such as stormwater and urban runoff and brackish groundwater. The SWIP increases water supply for reuse by harvesting and advance treating municipal wastewater, brackish groundwater, and stormwater and urban runoff. As designed, the SWIP would produce approximately 1,680 acre feet/year (AFY) or1.5 million gallons/day (MGD) of new water for immediate non-potable reuse, and when appropriately permitted, for indirect potable reuse via aquifer recharge. This volume is a critical first step in the Citys strategy for achieving water sustainability.  The estimated cost of the project is $69,893,435. Of this, $56,885,903 of the total project costs would be funded through a Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) agreement that provides low-interest financing and will forgive $4 million of the principal. The remainder of the project costs would be paid through the Clean Beaches and Ocean Parcel Tax Fund, the Stormwater Management Fund and the Wastewater Fund.  Staff recommends Council accept the proposed CWSRF agreement to allow the SWIP project to move forward. The project construction is expected to be completed by late 2020. The SWIP is one project in a series of strategic elements for water sustainability that include the adjacent Clean Beaches Project. Other projects under study include improving the efficiency of the Arcadia Treatment Plant to produce an additional 1.0 MGD of drinking water and exploration of the water resources available in the Coastal Subbasin. Taken together, these elements will help culminate in long-term sustainability.  The SWIP cost estimate and funding include services for an Owners Engineer. The SWIP Owners Engineer would, among other things, assist the City with various aspects related to project management, construction, regulatory permitting, and commissioning of the SWIP and permitting for the associated aquifer recharge component of the project. A Request for Proposal (RFP) for the SWIP Owners Engineer was issued on July 20, 2017. One firm, MWH/Stantec, responded. Because the Owners Engineer would be precluded from competing as the design-build contractor for the SWIP project, other qualified firms decided not to participate in the Owners Engineer RFP.

The County of Los Angeles is at an inflection point  the decisions made today both locally and regionally on policy and implementation of new programs will decide if the curve of homelessness continues to climb or whether strategic investments and collaborative efforts can turn the tide. Many cities are declaring a state of emergency to signal the importance of addressing this issue. Santa Monica has taken a more pragmatic approach, redeploying resources to service the homeless, engaging the business and resident communities, and serving as a regional partner with neighboring cities and the County. In response to Council naming homelessness as a strategic goal, staff formed an interdepartmental Homeless Strategic Goal team. This group worked across department lines to develop an action plan with seven desired outcomes (below) and associated goals and metrics which relate to the Citys outcomes regarding place and planet, economic opportunity, and community.  1.     Smart deployment of local resources 2.     Prove the efficacy of models that connect people to housing 3.     Increase availability of housing and services in other communities4.     Ensure effective, safe, respectful use of the Library5.     Active internal and external stakeholders 6.     Analyze the interventions that help people retain housing, and retain landlords7.     Prevent homelessness among low-income SM residents  As the surge in homeless individuals on our streets, in our parks and in our libraries is visible and disturbing, staff is testing new interventions in public spaces. A team of Human Services Division staff and two police officers recently engaged people experiencing homelessness at two parks in Santa Monica. They relied on Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) data during the interaction to connect homeless individuals to resources that correspond to their needs and tested the usefulness of using such data in the field. Regular and pop-up social services connections are happening at the Main Library, a model of bringing services to people where they already are.  As the team continues to implement its Action Plan, strategies will evolve and emerge, focusing on the most effective ways to address homelessness in Santa Monica. The Citys Action Plan is embedded in a larger strategic framework for dealing with the local impacts of the regional homelessness crisis. The four elements of this effort (which goes well beyond the scope and resources of City government) include:  1) To address the increase in homeless individuals in our community, we will relentlessly, humanely, compassionately, constitutionally and effectively engage people in distress.  This effort will encompass not only our front-line emergency response staff in Police and Fire. We will also provide scalable training and information that can be used by other City staff, non-profit service providers, Downtown Santa Monica Ambassadors and volunteer community members and businesspeople, as appropriate.2) To maximize the Citys resources, we will coordinate planning, communication and collaborative action across numerous city departments, community-based organizations, the business community and regional partners, working with a new Homeless Steering Committee that is being organized by these stakeholders. 3) To leverage available data, we will share useful information to provide appropriate assistance and to make allocation of resources and evaluation of interventions more accurate, timely and effective.4) Recognizing the regional nature of this challenge, we will actively work in support of the evolution and funding of the regional homeless services system that provides critical outreach, mental health, housing, health care and other services to make a difference in the lives of vulnerable people and support health, safety and equity in our local community. In addition, the City will deal firmly and effectively with criminal and anti-social behavior that is often mistakenly conflated with the problem of homelessness. Homeless people are more likely to be the victims of crime than perpetrators. There also exists, however, an increasingly estranged and alienated element of transient individuals whose drug and alcohol use, as well as criminal and/or chronic anti-social behaviors have made them menaces to public safety. This is a particularly difficult challenge to which law enforcement alone is an insufficient answer. We will work creatively and consistently to ensure the safety and enjoyment of Santa Monicas public spaces are not threatened by this small, but deeply troubled segment of our population. We will continue to treat people as individuals, not stigmatize all homeless people with the behaviors of a small fraction who constitute a threat to others. A Senior Advisor for Homelessness would focus exclusively on the overall approach to the homelessness issue out of the City Managers Office, further develop the four-pronged strategy and its implementation plans and long-term funding strategies, represent the Citys interests to intergovernmental and other partners, and engage the community on this issue. This approach is not new. In 2005 and 2006, Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman served the City in a somewhat similar role, advancing the Citys policies and priorities regarding regional collaboration and fair share allocation of resources. In addition, for many years City Managers Office senior staff members devoted significant time to local, state, and federal intergovernmental relations. Staffing patterns in the Managers Office have changed and capacity for this work has diminished, increasing the need for this position, which would bear primary responsibility for homelessness-related intergovernmental and community relations.  Given the increasing gravity of the regional homelessness crisis and its local impact, having a Senior Advisor for Homelessness as a member of the City Managers Office could further our progress profoundly and meaningfully. Establishing such a position would locate policy, program, and funding development in the executive office, increase intergovernmental and community relations capacity, and provide community and regional stakeholders with a single point of contact with direct access to the City Manager and Council. Departments would continue to offer, evaluate, and improve the numerous services dedicated to addressing homelessness and implement the strategic goal teams action plan.  Therefore, the City Manager requests the addition of one Senior Advisor on Homeless to be added to the City Managers Office for a two-year limited term basis, through June 2019. This position would be funded by the General Fund with an impact of $135,875 ($181,166 prorated to nine months for FY 2017-18) and $184,284 for FY 2018-19.  ", "background": "Over the course of 40 years, Santa Monicas local investment in permanent solutions to address homelessness has produced a sophisticated, collaborative approach effective in transitioning highly vulnerable individuals off the streets and into housing. The Citys homeless policies, like its service system, have evolved over many years to be a reflection of the priorities and needs of this community. Homelessness, however, is not an isolated local concern. Santa Monica is but one of 88 cities in LA County, which is home to the second largest homeless population in the country. Over 57,000 homeless individuals were identified through the 2017 LA County Homeless Count. Unlike other urban centers where the majority of homeless people are in shelters, 74% of LA Countys population is literally on the streets and in public spaces. The scale of the regional homeless crisis has pushed Santa Monicas local homeless system beyond its capacity to meet growing demand.  The plight of homelessness has taken on a higher profile and priority nationwide in the past year as local and state governments are becoming increasingly overwhelmed by the depth and breadth of this growing problem. The County of Los Angeles has adopted a set of 47 strategies (Attachment A) that encompass services, shelters, employment, benefits, outreach, jail diversion and system coordination and a funding plan for three years of projected Measure H revenue. The City of Los Angeles has begun awarding funding generated through Proposition HHH, a $1.2 billion bond measure passed in November 2016 to fund supportive and other types of housing for homeless people. Locally, Santa Monica residents voted to enact Measure GSH, a local transaction and use tax, a portion of which will fund affordable housing.  On August 23, 2015, City Council established taking a leadership role in regional efforts to address homelessness as one of the Citys top five strategic priorities (Attachment B). The Council instructed staff to do more on a regional level, especially by engaging with LA City and County partners to address these local impacts, and to continue to innovate and invest locally. The Community and Cultural Services Department (CCS) convenes the Chronic Homeless Project (CHP) which brings local and county services together to share resources and collaborate on case plans for homeless individuals. In addition, the Santa Monica Police Departments Homeless Liaison Program (HLP) team hosts an interdepartmental meeting to track progress and coordinate efforts to house chronic offenders. CCS also leads the Senior Housing Task Force, which brings together city departments and non-profit providers to identify and support low-income seniors at risk of homelessness, and partners with the City Attorneys Office to administer the Homeless Community Court. The Housing and Economic Development Department is dedicated to preserving existing affordable housing in Santa Monica and creating new housing opportunities for residents with low and moderate incomes. The Housing Division administers federal Continuum of Care vouchers, Section 8 housing vouchers, and Housing Trust funds for this purpose.  In June 2017, CCS and the City Manager initiated a community homelessness steering committee comprised of representatives from the business community, City commissions, faith partners, non-profit agencies, LA County services as well as state and county elected offices. Local organizations such as the Westside Coalition, Downtown Santa Monica, Inc., Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce and Santa Monica Travel and Tourism frequently invite CCS staff to provide updates on local and regional homeless issues. Regionally, the City participates in a range of planning meetings hosted by LA Countys Chief Executive Office, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority and the United Way of Greater LA, and represents the Westside Cities Council of Governments on the Regional Homeless Advisory Council. The City also meets regularly with other Westside jurisdictions and state and county elected offices to coordinate regional efforts and leverage local resources.  The City is also pursuing a range of responses to safety in public spaces  funding Ambassadors into Tongva and Palisades Park, heavily programming Reed Park with activities and focusing law enforcement on Chess Park.  All have had some success, but all require a level of resources that are currently difficult to scale and sustain citywide.  ", "summary": "Homelessness is one of our societys most pernicious and stubborn challenges. Los Angeles County is experiencing a mounting crisis with this years annual Homeless Count showing a 23% increase countywide and a 26% increase in Santa Monica (after five years of no increases following a significant decline).  Santa Monica will not accept that homelessness is inevitable. While the regional homeless crisis cant be solved within our borders, our City is determined to invest additional local resources, stand with neighboring communities and take a leadership role in regional solutions. We will gather and share timely data to track and analyze both overall progress and individual cases and share the models that prove effective; we will relentlessly and compassionately engage people experiencing homelessness in order to make appropriate referrals to local and regional programs; we will mobilize a community-wide effort to augment and target public, non-profit, civic and business resources; we will work with LA County, LA City and other regional partners to continually innovate, pursuing effective and compassionate approaches wherever they can be found. City staff believe this comprehensive approach can make a difference in the lives of vulnerable people and support health, safety and equity in our local community.  Such a comprehensive and sustained community-wide approach will require a significant increase in the level of resources devoted to staff training, outreach efforts, social services, housing placement and retention, law enforcement, public information and education, data collection, analysis, and sharing. Naming a Senior Advisor for Homelessness to focus exclusively on the issue out of the City Managers Office would locate policy, program, and resource development in the executive office, create new capacity for intergovernmental and community relations to better leverage and coordinate our partnerships with regional agencies, Los Angeles County and nearby cities, as well as enlist residents, businesses, civic organizations, houses of worship and local non-profits in collaborative action.   "}, "title": " Request for a Senior Advisor on Homelessness", "Sponsors": null, "recommendations": [""], "Department": "City Manager's Office, Administration"}, {"title": null}, {"title": null}], [], [], [], [{"Category": "07.

The Citys Zoning Ordinance also authorizes TUPs for fairs, festivals, or similar compatible temporary uses.  In order to minimize the impacts that this Coast event will have on businesses located within or near the event and to enable these businesses to undertake activities in conjunction with the event, it is necessary for the Council to enact this emergency interim ordinance to expand the frequency that TUPs may be obtained for sidewalk sales when these additional sales are undertaken in conjunction with a City-produced public street event and to waive the filing fee for TUPs sought in conjunction with this event. The current filing fee for a TUP application is $1,508.79.  As proposed in the Interim Ordinance, the issuance of a TUP for a sidewalk sale by a Business Improvement District or Area that is geographically located, in whole or in part, within the parameters of a City Public Street Event authorized pursuant to Administrative Instruction II-4-4 of the Citys Community Events Law or by any business not within business improvement districts and areas but located within a 750 foot radius of the City Public Street Event and that will be exercised contemporaneous with and in conjunction with the City Public Street Event would not count towards the TUP numerical limitation established in SMMC Section 9.31.370(B)(2)(d). In addition, no filing fee would be required for any TUP sought by a Business Improvement District or Area that is geographically located within the parameters of a City Public Street Event authorized pursuant to Administrative Instruction II-4-4 or by any business located within business improvement districts and areas but located within a 750-foot radius of the City Public Street Event and that will be exercised contemporaneous with and in conjunction with the City Public Street Event. This Interim Ordinance will be effective immediately and shall be of no further force or effect sixty days after its adoption, unless prior to that date, after a public hearing, noticed pursuant to Santa Monica Municipal Code Section 9.37.050, the City Council, by majority vote, extends this interim ordinance Adoption of the Emergency Interim Ordinance would minimize any potential adverse impacts to businesses created by the Coast event and allow for increased community and business participation in this unique, one-day event.     ", "background": "City Public Street Events are authorized pursuant to Administrative Instruction II-4-4 of the Citys Community Events Law. The one-day Coast event will allow pedestrian and bicycle access to streets free of automobiles with activity hubs along the route and will extend approximately 2.5 miles encompassing portions of Main Street, Colorado Avenue, Ocean Avenue, and the Third Street Promenade. The event will focus on sustainable mobility while incorporating art, culture, and environmental learning opportunities throughout.  The City is working closely with local businesses and neighborhood and community partners to ensure favorable and mutually beneficial outcomes from the Coast event. Businesses located along and close to the Coast event route depend on street access and accessibility to public parking for their employees and customers. Businesses located on the streets encompassed within this event or within close proximity to the event have expressed concern about the impact the event will have on their businesses given the significant reduction in automobile traffic that will be allowed and the fact that certain streets and public parking lots in the area will become wholly inaccessible to vehicles. These businesses have also expressed the desire to undertake activities such as sidewalk and food/beverage sales in conjunction with the event. The inaugural COAST Festival took place in 2016 with Council adopting a similar emergency interim ordinance to the one proposed (Attachment B). Following the COAST Festival, a survey was administered to all businesses along the COAST route and to those that participated in conjunction with the event. The overall feedback was positive as the businesses appreciated the increased exposure during the event and expressed their desire to participate in more events in the future.  ", "summary": "On October 1, 2017, the City will celebrate its second Coast Festival  a City-produced Open Streets event to celebrate mobility, culture, and sustainability. The City is working closely with local businesses and neighborhood and community partners who have expressed the desire to undertake activities such as sidewalk and food/beverage sales in conjunction with the event.  The Citys Zoning Ordinance authorizes Temporary Use Permits (TUPs) for sidewalk sales. However, sidewalk sales located on the public right of way are limited to two events within any 12-month period, and Business Improvement Districts are limited to two such events within any 12-month period. Certain Business Improvement Districts will already reach this numerical limitation based on sidewalk sales events that have already been undertaken or will be undertaken apart from this City event.  In order to minimize the impacts that this public Coast event will have on businesses located within or near the event and to enable these businesses to undertake activities in conjunction with the event, it is necessary for the Council to enact this emergency interim ordinance to expand the frequency that temporary use permits may be obtained for sidewalk sales when these additional sales are undertaken in conjunction with a City-produced public street event and to waive the filing fee for temporary use permits sought in conjunction with this event. "}, "title": " Adoption of an Emergency Interim Ordinance to Authorize the Issuance of Additional Temporary Use Permits for Temporary Sidewalk Sales Undertaken in Conjunction with a City Public Street Event by Business Improvement Districts and Areas and by Businesses Located within a Seven Hundred Fifty Foot Radius of the City Event and Waiving the Filing Fee for Temporary Use Permits that Will Be Exercised During the City Public Street Event by These Entities", "Sponsors": null, "recommendations": ["     Adopt the attached emergency interim ordinance authorizing the issuance of additional Temporary Use Permits for temporary sidewalk sales undertaken in conjunction with a City public street event by business improvement districts and area and by businesses located within a 750-foot radius of the City event; and", "     Waive the filing fee for Temporary Use Permits that will be exercised in conjunction with and contemporaneous with the City public street event by these entities."], "Department": "Development Review 2"}, {"Category": "07. Ordinances", "body": {"other": "AB 1236 has specific requirements intended to provide \"consistent statewide standards,\" and to \"promote and encourage\" the use of electric vehicle charging stations, and the proposed ordinance includes all such requirements. AB 1236 requires that a jurisdiction adopt a checklist of requirements with which a permit application for an electric vehicle charging station will be eligible for expedited review. AB 1236 explicitly provides that a jurisdiction may, in developing the ordinance and standards, refer to the recommendations in the most current version of the Plug-In Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Permitting Checklist of the Zero-Emission Vehicles in California: Community Readiness Guidebook (Attachment B) published by the Governors Office of Planning and Research. As such, the City's expedited-review technical standards and checklist would be consistent with the recommendations noted in the \"Plug-In Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Permitting Checklist.\"  The City's checklist (Attachment C) would be published on the City's website and contain objective requirements for the installation of an electric vehicle charging station, as well as a process for electronic submittal of permit applications. The applicant would note the features of the existing electrical service on the checklist, such as:          Rating in amperes         System voltage         Connected or calculated load         Spare capacity in amperes         Voltage and ampere rating of the electric vehicle supply equipment         Circuit rating of the electric vehicle supply equipment         Location of the electric vehicle supply equipment         If ventilation is/or is not required The checklist would also assist the applicant in confirming that the location of the electric vehicle supply equipment will comply with any vehicle clearance requirements in the Citys Zoning Ordinance.  AB1236 also clarifies that a jurisdiction shall not condition the approval of a permit for an electric vehicle charging station based on the approval of an association, as that term is defined in Civil Code Section 4080.  If a permit application satisfies the information requirements of the checklist, the application will be deemed complete, and must be processed promptly. Furthermore, if the application and supporting documents meet the requirements of the checklist, and are consistent with all applicable laws, the City must approve the application and issue the permit. Staff recommends that City Council introduce for first reading the attached ordinance, given the requirement of Government Code Section 65850.7 that local agencies adopt such an ordinance to create an expedited, streamlined permitting process for electric vehicle charging stations. Most of the procedures, such as electronic submittal of plans, are currently in place.  However, the ordinance is required for the City to timely comply with AB 1236.  Staff is confident that the implementation of an expedited, streamlined process will be available to permit applicants upon approval of the ordinance.  Building and Fire-Life Safety Commission ActionThe Building Officer held a public meeting with the Building and Fire-Life Safety Commission on August 23, 2017, where the Commission heard staffs proposed procedures for an expedited, streamlined process for electric vehicle charging stations. The Commission provided comments regarding balancing the requirement for expedited processing with the need to verify the fire, life and safety aspects of electric vehicle charging stations and maintenance of public protection. The proposed application and checklist process would create a standardized system of issuing permits for compliant installations. Staff assured the Commission that all requirements of fire-life-safety will be verified during the review and inspection for the electric vehicle charging stations. The Commission's action was a recommendation to approve the ordinance.Staff is in the process of implementing measures to meet the requirements of Assembly Bill 1236 (2015). This includes finalizing the application checklist in conjunction with the Plug-In Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Permitting Checklist of the Zero-Emission Vehicles in California: Community Readiness Guidebook, measures for electrical compliance, and standard items for fire prevention safety. Building inspection staff will also develop procedures for expedient and thorough inspection of the electric vehicle charging stations. Permitting staff will be trained on the new procedures, and the Citys website will be updated with the new procedures.   ", "background": "The City has already been processing permit applications for electric vehicle charging stations in a consistent, streamlined, and expeditious manner (in most cases \"over-the-counter\"). For the current year (2017) to date, the City has issued five permits for 23 electric vehicle charging stations, and for 2016, issued 12 permits for 20 stations. Current City practice for processing electric vehicle charging station permits typically entails having the permit applicant come to the City's Permit Counter with an application and supporting documentation; the application requires details of the proposed charging station, along with a site plan detailing where the charging station would be located. In most cases, the application is reviewed and processed then and there by a plan checker who is stationed at the counter. To the extent that the City's current permitting process for electric vehicle charging stations is already prompt and streamlined, staff does not expect significant changes to the existing process.  ", "summary": "Staff brings the proposed ordinance in order to comply with state law. Assembly Bill 1236 (AB 1236: 2015, Chiu, Codified as Government Code Section 65850.7) requires local jurisdictions with a population less than 200,000 residents to adopt an ordinance to create an expedited, streamlined permitting process for electric vehicle charging stations on or before September 30, 2017.  The proposed ordinance meets the requirements of AB1236 by empowering the City's Building Official to implement an expedited administrative permit review process for electric vehicle charging stations and adopting a checklist of requirements for permit applicants to comply with in order to be eligible for an expedited permit review. The ordinance provides that if the permit application satisfies the information requirements in the City's checklist, the application will be deemed complete and must be promptly processed. The ordinance also allows for electronic submittal of permit applications; acceptance of electronic signatures on forms and documentation related to the permit application; and publication of the City's checklist on the City's website, all of which are intended to facilitate and promote the use of electric vehicle charging stations.  "}, "title": " Introduction for First Reading of an Ordinance setting forth an Expedited and Streamlined Permitting Process for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations as required by Government Code Section 65850.7", "Sponsors": null, "recommendations": ["(Attachment A) which sets forth an expedited, streamlined permitting process for electric vehicle charging stations in compliance with State law.", ""], "Department": "Planning and Community Development"}], [], [], [], [], [], [{"Department": "City Clerk 13-Items", "Category": "13.
